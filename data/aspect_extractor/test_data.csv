We had booked 3 rooms with children and were sitting relaxing outside when the kitchen staff started cleaning up.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The language used was disgusting and when we asked them to tone it down they got louder and cruder;0;0;0;1;0;0

Everything was clean and staff were really friendly.;1;0;0;0;1;0
The only downfall was the fact we had nothing to cook on....as others have said an electric frying pan would have been adequate and would have made our stay perfect.....something Harbour View should really look into;0;0;0;0;0;1

Was a bit concerned when we arrived as the entrance does not appear to be that great however the owners could not have been nicer and although they did not speak much English were still able to communicate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was good although a set time of 9am meant we missed it a couple of times when leaving early for a trip;0;1;0;0;0;0
Excellent location condition and staff.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Don't forget to communicate with the hotel before arriving.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was conveniently located at the north end of Via Duomo which put it within walking distance of the old town pedestrianized areas and restaurants.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It is also close to a metro stop.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Naples is a very walkable city and this location worked out well.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Plenty of hot water for showers the WiFi and cable TV worked perfectly and the mini fridge actually kept drinks super cold a rarity in that size refrigerator.;0;1;0;1;0;0

Otherwise our stay was perfect and at a reasonable price.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The area feels safe and was well lit.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would highly recommend and will be staying there again in the future.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This facility is very out dated shabby and does not appear clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Carpets and bedding are worn thread-bare and stained.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Walls have many scuff marks and the entire place is under-inviting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is next to the Park where the deers roam free and an Art Exhibition is in the park.;0;0;1;1;0;0
I was very satisfied with the staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The onsen was the reason why we picked the hotel and definitely worth it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel also had a huge bathroom my bathroom experience was awesome.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Because the bathrooms have been very small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Ryokan is perfectly located near Nara Park and the major attractions.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff is friendly and very helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Public bath on first floor with both indoor and outdoor warm soaking pools separate men's and women's was delightful!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was Japanese style with tatami flooring and futon/duvets for sleeping.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Buckwheat pillows a little firm but still slept like a log!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Recommend highly!;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is maybe  I am quite sure though the best hotel I have ever been to.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wonderfully located the 5 story pagoda is maybe 100 meters away... wonderful service beautiful and comfortable room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
In-house beautiful onsen.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Incredible breakfast we had our table prepared with variety of dishes in a private alcove !;0;1;0;0;0;0
Surely not overpriced for its quality.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bravo !;0;0;0;0;0;0
So happily shocked at the large size traditional Japanese room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
They even have a liitle kids amenities bag for my daughter and multiple bags of free snacks in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Public bathhouse was also large and mostly vacant.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location is right across the street from the Kintetsu Nara Station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I only wished we stayed more than 1 night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location is prime.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Next to Nara Park n also train station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Excellent location next to Kintetsu Nara station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room was large with nice amenities.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Definitely recommend to stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A pleasant stay but the staff could have been more welcoming.;0;0;0;0;1;0
location was great as it was just beside the nara train station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was very courteous and made you feel welcome.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Like the public bath which comes with an outdoor bath as well!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Advice don't pay for the dinner or breakfast you get much better value for money if you eat at the eating places at the nara station.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Booked over the net and didn't realise it was a ryokan hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was exceptional.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Located next to the major park/tourist attraction of Nara very short walk to Nara station and the BEST onsen I have found so far.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff were as you expect good staff to be without being over the top.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Absolutely brilliant!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Don't go there this hotel is all mine!!! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
They really need to fix the air conditioning here.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The rooms are very small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast not good for the price.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I would recommend to go to local restaurant instead of paying the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is much cheaper and better.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was super friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great central location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms are dated but clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Only negative was AC struggled to keep room cool.;0;0;0;1;0;0
A beautiful hotel that is well located to nice places nearby.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Location is excellent for both local and JR stations.;0;0;1;0;0;0
A quiet street with a variety of shops and restaurants;0;0;0;0;0;0
In the prime area of Nara close to shopping eating and public transportation and still by foot you can easily access Nara's park temple landscape....;0;0;1;0;0;0
We were disappointed the area was cool but the hotel not so much.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Comfortable and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice breakfast buffet with both authentic Japanese and western items.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Highly recommended.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very comfortable well appointed Hotel on Sanjo Dori the main shopping street that runs from Nara station to the famous deer park.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We walked to all the sights from here and very much enjoyed our stay in Nara.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Highly recommended.;0;0;0;0;0;0
the hotel is walkable to pretty much everywhere while we were there shops restaurants even the deers temple.;0;0;0;0;0;0
very respectful and helpful staffs.;0;0;0;0;1;0
and yes they speak english well.;0;0;0;0;0;0
clean hotel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
one thing we didn't like was the breakfast buffet  it wasn't what we expected for breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
overall we give the hotel 5 stars.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is located in a great position for reaching many of Nara's prime tourist locations.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It is also close to two JR stations for getting around.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The hotel is clearly old-ish.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The keycard readers seem to use physical holes instead of digital codes which wasn't a great sign.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Wi-fi was also quite spotty.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But overall it's a good hotel for a good price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We absolutely loved the hotel room!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Hotel staff were great and English was not a barrier to excellent service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Clean convenient and polite staff.;1;0;0;0;1;0
I enjoyed my stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel is conveniently located near the kintetsu line and close to attractions like the Deer Park Todai-ji and Kasuga-Taisha;0;0;1;0;0;0
This hotel was hard for me to locate even through  GPS as I drove from Kyoto  but the worst was my room  so noisy  it was because all the dishes  bowls and kitchen wares were cleaning just next to my room after dinner from Restaurant.... Can you imagine??? ?;0;1;0;1;0;0
Great location - 5 min max by foot from station and 15min from park a lot of places around to eat.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Compared to other hotels in Japan - this wasn't that clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Also in-room stuff like tables etc was dated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
For dinner and breakfast - it would be nice to have some 'instructions' included as it hard to get what it is and what is for : but staff tries its best to explain with little english knowledge.;0;1;0;0;1;0
WiFi was weak and dropping often.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great experience with traditional ryokan.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very kind and polite staff speak good English.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The food is great.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Service is fatastic.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It is very close to Nara Park where famous  Dodai-ji and Dear Park are.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Best of all there is modern private bathroom as well as traditional hot bath.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Will definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely traditional place with remarkable breakfasts and dinners included.;0;1;0;0;0;0
An amazing place where you're welcomed and treated as family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The property might seem dated but to us it was part of the charm with an immense Japanese-style room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The breakfast was excellent and the location at the the heart of Nara speaks for itself.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Hotel was very helpful on arrival and accomodating with luggage.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was in very nice condition and large I reserved a 6-person room for one of me.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Location was the best feature as Nara park is a couple short blocks away as well as several businesses and restaurants.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nice good friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
All are out of my expectation.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will stay again next time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's an old Japanese traditional hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No English TV.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Everybody speak Japanese.front desk closed in 11:00pm.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No bed sleep on the floor but it is comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast is good and free.;0;1;0;0;0;0
This hotel was a lot of fun.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms were traditional and very spacious.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We got the half board so supper was provided and it was a beautiful spread of everything you would imagine for a Japanese dinner.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The staff was very helpful and courteous.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The view could have been better from our room and there wasn't a lovely garden on the property but we enjoyed our stay simply based on the food the staff and the comfortable room.;0;1;0;1;1;0
Terrible storms.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wonderful hotel staff made our extra night bearable.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The  restaurant was top quality and the rooms beautifully appointed and clean!;1;0;0;1;0;0
Our friend who never stays in motels and nothing less than 5 star would stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely Narooma despite the storms! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely area and motel close handy to all conveniences and beaches.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Spent one night there last weekend.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The staff were friendly the owner showed us around and organised parking out the back for us even after a 21:30 arrival.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room was recently renovated with a modern bathroom and a living room overlooking the bay.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We'd definitely come back.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Bathroom and bed were very clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Wifi was completely unusable in both speed and connectivity.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food at the restaurant was good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Over-all not good value for the total experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room had probably not been used for months as the temperature on the A/C was set at heat at 30 degrees.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There WAS a dead cockroach on  my bedside table and the place smelt musty.;0;0;1;1;1;0
There was also a sewing needle complete with red thread stuck in the blue curtains near the sofa.;0;0;1;1;0;0
We were quite disappointed with our stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room had a great view of the ocean  was clean and tidy.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Across street from ocean and Narrangansett long oceanside sidewalk;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice view and great outside dining;0;0;0;0;0;1
Location was good staff was not helpful and room was dirty.;1;0;1;1;1;0
staff was great very friendly cozy room clean organized and had a really comfortable look and feel to it.;1;0;0;1;1;0
accurate photos on their site;0;0;0;0;0;0
Right from the moment we arrived we felt VERY welcomed!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was just great and you could see the attention to detail and how clean it was.;1;0;0;1;0;0
All of our needs were met and we look forward to being guests again in the near future!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Our room was adorable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was retro in design and boutique-like.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was immaculate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The reason why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 is that the air conditioner was very difficult to control and keep set in a cool position.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I woke up very warm in the middle of the night and by the morning the air conditioning kicked on and the temperature was nice and cool.;0;0;0;1;0;0
That was a little frustrating but otherwise...I enjoyed my stay there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice clean room and bathroom.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Friendly helpful staff. A;0;0;0;0;1;0
Very clean...Very comfortable...Great Staff...Great Food  the Turtle Soup.;1;1;0;0;1;0
Had a wonderful experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was beautiful.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bed was so comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent value.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Loved the retaurant.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Ate dinner on porch.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Located on the hill above the centre of town this comfortable guesthouse have great views of the harbour below and the surrounding mountains.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The hotel is a cute place in a quiet location and was very clean and comfortable.;1;0;1;0;0;0
The front desk staff is professional and the breakfast buffet is fantastic.;0;1;0;0;1;0
The room was small but I wasn't there to hang out in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My only complaint was with the thin walls I could hear someone snoring in the next room which drives me insane.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The location is a bit of a tough walk uphill with a heavy bag but only about 10 minutes from the train station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Arrived at midnight keys and instructions all waiting for collection .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
When you walk in for the first time you think 'This is an older hotel.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I hope it isn't terrible.';0;0;0;0;0;0
I was in Norway for 14 nights and stayed in 9 different hotels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bed and pillow at Breidablikk Gjestehus were by far THE BEST!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The breakfast was great with a terrific view and the service was outstanding.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Well done Breidablikk Gjestehus!;0;0;0;0;0;0
very small bed and room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very simple and crude bathing suppliment.;0;0;0;0;0;0
no parking lot.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only good is window view to see harbor but other hotel has the same view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It's OK.  Not amazing;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A very comfortable stay.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Good breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The hotel looks a bit like a hospital.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Improve on the interiors especially the corridors.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel policy is very reserved and coordination among them was horrible.;0;0;0;0;0;0
After complete payment also they called and asked for the payment.;0;0;0;0;0;1
After producing the entire evidence they said it was mistake by their side.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Absolutely unprofessional behaviour.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The stay wasnt that pleasant.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Have got to get the room changed due to no wifi coverage and malfunctiond refrigerator.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The refrigerator in the new room wasnt working too.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Had to get the refrigerator changed then.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bathroom door lock was stuck too.;0;0;0;1;0;0
so so ..not bad...;0;0;0;0;0;0
Value for money.;0;0;0;0;0;1
great front desk staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Very average food would prefer eating outside Best part is that it is very close to Sula  Trayambakeshwar both.;0;1;0;0;0;0
It was very bad experience  wifi was not working.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Staff were not friendly  gud .;0;0;0;0;1;0
Hotel staff is courteous  punctual under the leadership of manager Mr. Hasan.;0;0;0;0;1;0
He take extra effort to improve your overall experience with the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No good direction to Motel hard to find it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No smoking rooms had bad smoking smell.;1;0;0;1;0;0
They have to change my room because of smell.;1;0;0;1;0;0
I know it is not high standard motel but my experience with other Motel 6 was better than this one.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Two separate rooms and both rooms where first floor with unbearable noise from above.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We stayed there for work for 7 days they never cleaned our room too many people live in there;1;0;0;1;0;0
Very noisy all night as ‘guests ‘ were coming and going all night.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We finally left at 3:30am.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No sleep does not make a happy customer;0;0;0;1;0;0
Convenient;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only thing that was a bother was the room doors all slammed shut preventing us from a sound sleep.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice and quite;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was wifi in the rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There wasn't a refrigerator or microwave.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Comfortable for sleeping and swimming;0;0;0;0;0;0
People above were noisy and room had odor of cigarettes.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I PAID AND WAS CHARGED THROUGH TRAVELOCITY A NON-SMOKING ROOM WITH A REFIGERATOR AND MIRCOWAVE WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE.;0;0;0;1;0;0
OUR THOUGHTS WERE: WE PAID 98.17 A NIGHT FOR A 35.00 A NIGHT ROOM.;0;0;0;1;0;0
WE ARE EXTREMLY UNHAPPY.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was stripped meaning no clock no frig no hair dryer no micro wave.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was there 1 week not overnight.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was clean and decent.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Great price when money is tight but depending on the room you get sometimes it would be better to sleep in your vehicle close to a 24hr bathroom;0;0;0;1;0;0
The front desk staff was the only silver lining at this place.;0;0;0;0;1;0
My non-smoking room had cigarette burns on the side of the tub and many burn holes in the blanket on the bed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bed was only made once in our 4 night stay and the dirty towels were left on the dresser one day.;1;0;0;0;0;0
We were looking for a budget place and got less than we expected.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is eh.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room smelled like cigarette smoking despite it being a non smoking room and the mattress had odd stains.;1;0;0;1;0;0
At the end of the day it was safe and *hopefully* clean but I would recommend looking elsewhere.;1;0;0;0;0;0
FOR A FAMILY WITH CHILDREN IT IS A GOOD HOTEL WITHOUT ANY SMOKING.;0;0;0;0;0;0
THE AIR IS FRESH AND GOOD.;0;0;0;0;0;0
BESIDES THERE IS A PRETTY SWIMMING POOL.;0;0;0;0;0;1
IF BREAKFAST AND FREE WIFI COULD BE AVAILABLE IT WOULD BE PERFECT.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Wasn't good there was cops there all the time .;0;0;0;0;0;0
and they make u pay for WiFi;0;0;0;0;0;1
Passing through needed beds for the night.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Price was right.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Hotel staff was nice and the front office was clean.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Room has been updated but the small of cigarette smoke was a deal breaker.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We had a non smoking room but it was like someone had just smoked a hundred packs of marlboros.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Needless to say we couldn't sleep and nothing got rid of the small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The next issue was the sheets were not clean and the bedspread looked used.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nice.. Would go there again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great staff and good food!;0;1;0;0;1;0
Wish we could’ve spent more time there!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Beautiful condo very clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing view of the golf course.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Loved our stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Booked another stay in just a few weeks.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great place for a great price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Nice roomy place! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great golf place to stay in nearby Columbus IN 16 mi and just down the street to Nashville.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Depending on Condo you're put in these are nice and nicer facilities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
All overlooking golf course.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The condo was very nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only thing was the bed was uncomfortable they need to get some new mattresses.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Otherwise was very nice and close to everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Better than expected!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The condo was clean and roomy.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Great view of the golf course and a few short steps from the restaurant/bar and pro shop.;0;1;0;0;0;0
A couple updates would make this place perfect.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was only one actual coffee cup in the cabinet the TVs are old and outdated only 3 washcloths in the bathroom.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pretty minor complaints on an otherwise terrific place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lots of privacy and absolutely peaceful nights.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Spacious and quite.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Nice golf course.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Bed was not very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
View from the balcony was nice.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The condo was very comfortable clean and pleasant.;1;0;0;0;0;0
We would definitely stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff beautiful surroundings and sparkling clean accommodations.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Was clean top quality of service  The location was beautiful The 19th hole is a must-try food is great surface is great lots of fun just visiting with locals have family in the area will always stay here every time we come to town.;0;1;1;0;1;0
My condo was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very spacious and clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I felt like I was home.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was wonderful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great atmospherebeautiful view from the room all the people at the resort down to earth would go back soon.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I had a terrible experience at your hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were issued room #121   When we opened the door the ceiling was on the floor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was a large leak falling groom the roof and the carpet was wet and the odor was horrible.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We immediately cancelled our reservation and left the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We request a refund.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The clerk cancelled our room and we are waiting for refund.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Terrible.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bed bugs.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
They rummaged through the bags.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was a good visit courteous and was clean;1;0;0;0;1;0
It was one of the worst rooms I have ever had the displeasure of staying in.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The room was filthy they dealt drugs outside all night long and the service was horrible.;1;0;0;1;1;0
When attempting to address management was argumentative and nasty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Reserved form 1 week and stayed one night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Relocated to Day's Inn and never slept better.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room was dated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bathroom needed some cleaning.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Mild in shower tile.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I made the mistake of booking this online because we were next door at Cracker Barrel and it was cheap and convenient.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I did not read the reviews and I definitely should have.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Sheets Were obviously not washed and ripped.;0;0;0;0;0;1
A large crack in the door with only one lock.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Won’t stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Scary place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wouldn’t recommend;0;0;0;0;0;0
The door to the room had to be forcefully closed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Even when closed you could see outside because door wasn't sealed nor installed correctly.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bathroom lights were like 10 watt.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room lights were like 30 watt.;0;0;0;1;0;0
So basically you can't see anything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Ice machine was broke.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It snowed real bad that week.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They didn't clear any of it for their customers.;0;0;0;0;0;0
So if I can't sleep good then I'm definitely not comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Maid knocked on my door 10 mins before checkout and TOLD me to 'GET OUT';0;0;0;0;1;0
Numerous pubic hairs on sheets.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Apparently linen remains unchanged between guest check-ins.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Shower/Tub inoperable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
NO WATER  This property should be condemned by the board of health.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stay away.;0;0;1;1;1;0
I know I will.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was not just a dirty hole stinking of smoke xxx;1;0;0;0;0;0
Had to take an Uber to go Downtown the room smelled like mothballs but the price was reasonable and quiet environment.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Facility had nice staff however we found rat feces in the room the shower was literally a spicket  in the wall and the building was in disaray.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The shower didn't work so I had to take a shower outside by the pool.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The TV only got one station as well.;0;0;1;1;0;0
The wifi signal was fairly strong from my cabin.;0;0;0;0;0;0
All I needed was a place to sleep so I dealt with both problems but anyone needing more out of this place might want to look elsewhere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My experience is unlivable  wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone;0;0;0;0;0;0
My stay was ok..the room was spacious enough.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The property did not offer any food service so you are forced to search the local area.;0;1;1;0;1;0
Also there was a advertising of a continiental breakfast and there was none as previously stated the property had no food service for their guests.;0;1;0;0;1;0
The drive in was scary the room was cleanish but a window unit and tube TV was not good.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Awkward location dilapidated condition.;0;0;1;0;0;0
There wasn't even a mirror in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No clock tv phone etc.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The shower water was cool and salty.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No screens on the windows and a broken AC unit.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There were bugs no seem ums and big flies.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The door only dead bolted from the inside and I wasn't sure how secure the door was in the frame it was gaped and  warped.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Overall I didn't feel safe and it was dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Just needed a room for a Dr. Visit central location breakfast included.;0;1;1;1;0;0
Clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;0;0;0
A bit run down but staff were lovely.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This hotel is very different from what is advertised online;0;0;0;0;0;0
I know this is a 2 star hotel but I paid 90 per night for a room with no wifi and incredibly old furniture.;0;0;0;1;0;0
You could tell most of the things inside were bought many years ago and some furniture even had holes.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The shower was a joke.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Some members of the staff were very nice and some were pretty rude..;0;0;0;0;1;0
The Ac did not work in my room no hot water in the shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But the staff was really nice.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was ok..;0;0;0;0;0;0
Loved the Security he was very helpful.. there was not much parking;0;0;0;0;0;1
Within walking distance to the Junkanoo beach and restaurants and the downtown area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Parking is included.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was the best I have ever had.;0;0;0;0;1;0
There was on site security which was wonderful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Any help I needed they were completely on top of it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I have never experienced a nicer set of people.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I will definitely be back.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Didn’t look like pictures online WiFi was really poor had to ask for hot water but overall the staff was really nice and wasn’t so bad after all.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Close to a great beach bar “Tiki bikini hut” and downtown.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Was on vacation the hotel didn’t have to look spectacular as long as I had a clean bed and hot water I was good.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very dated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would be great after a refurb.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beds and towels were clean bit NO hot water.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast not available ans free coffee is available in reception but not in your room.;0;1;0;1;1;0
Use Michael Taxi;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great little place to stay very close to the beach and beach bars and a close walk to the shops.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Taxi fare from the airport was 35.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Seemed like a safe area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was lovely.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Hotel will hold bags for later flights and arrange taxi.;0;0;0;0;0;0
everything was OK the place is nice and cozy clean can use maintenance but my whole stay there was no hot water I would have to let water run for a looooonnnnnnng time to even get a little warm water;1;0;0;0;0;0
Close to everything was worse staying in staff was wonderful;0;0;0;0;1;0
Right across the street from the Tiki Bar.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Loved it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is under renovation.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had to switch rooms because of plumbing malfunctions but the staff was extremely accommodating and the room we ended up in was lovely.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Overall we'd highly recommend the El Greco.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's close to everything and we just can't say enough about how nice the staff is.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Despite the repairs it's going through the hotel itself has a lot of character and charm -- more than others in the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was good!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel staff were exellent!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Customer Service was great!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Booked online showed up and was informed there was no hot water.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Who doesn't want to take a shower after a long day of traveling day at the beach or sweating in the heat.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Location was good if you want to be in the downtown area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room dark sheets old with holes bathroom not cleaned faucet all dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
No way thank god was for only one night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The day after we moved to Atlantis Royal tower;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel staff was nice and helpful but room was run down.;0;0;0;1;1;0
We requested a balcony room on Orbitz but didn't receive one.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Street noise was very loud.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was a rip in the shower curtain so water sprayed out on to the toilet when the shower was on and shower head also leaked and had terrible water pressure.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sheets were clean but over bleached and starched.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Overall an uncomfortable stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Spend a little more money for something more comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No Hot Water in the bath unless you ask for it and only the Owner/Manager can turn it on no Coffee or Tea provided or even available at any time.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Grumpy manager.;0;0;0;0;1;0
No restaurant open for breakfast or anything.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I was advised to go around the corner to a coffee shop.;0;1;0;0;0;0
This was an awful experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I signed out after the first night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The floor was dingy and the bathroom curtains were filthy.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It was below par and had no Internet access in the room;0;0;0;1;0;0
One thing I don't like I booked a reservation with travelocity for one night on July 23/2015 confirmation 7120975896679  room total cost 98.00 per night plus tax 7.35 total cost 105.35. when I arrived at El Greco hotel I was told they did not receive any confirmation number for the room that I booked with travelocity So I have pay a next fee for the room which cost 125.I would to get my 105.35 back.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very nice small motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Has about 30 rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff are very courteous.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Pool had some leaves in it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The beach is right across the street and downtown is in walking distance or catch the Jitney Bus.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would book this motel again when in Nassau visiting family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was just staying here overnight to go on a scuba trip the next day.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It served the purpose.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There is a nice beach directly across the street and a few restaurants within walking distance.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The overall was average and in need of cosmetic type maintenance.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would stay here again for this purpose.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Access to busses and nearby restaurants and beach.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Very friendly staff which made the stay wonderful;0;0;0;0;1;0
The hotel staff was awesome and I loved my stay with them!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Finding the property was easy Friendly Staff clean rooms and a location that can't be beat;1;0;1;1;1;0
Hotel is nice  they upgraded us to a bigger room with more beds bigger bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great AC.;0;0;0;0;0;0
breakfast has a great variety.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Only problem is the location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We had to walk to the Main Street to catch the bus and the walk feels dangerous and the sides are full of trash abandoned cars.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Doesn't feel safe to walk at night.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff is very nice and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It's just the location that didn't work for me.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It's too far from everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Quite and very nice staffs  pool and room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Staff are very friendly and helpful esp especially the lady from house keeping;0;0;0;0;1;0
Okay place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A lil walking.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good to see what’s there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Won’t stay again tho.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed in the suite.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to the beach.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
They cleaned very well.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I didnt expect the service like that.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The staff were very nice;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great place;0;0;0;0;0;0
We will be going back.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wish they did lunch and dinner though.;0;1;0;0;0;0
But still good time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was so nice and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The hotel itself is nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was helpful and our suite had a full kitchen.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The downside is that the street doesn't appear to be the most appealing place and may seem a little dangerous at night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Unfortunately there wasn't a bar!!!;0;1;0;0;0;0
And our swipe card didn't work cos batteries were gone in the door.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But location good to get out and about and we made friends with the hotel cat...Mr  concks;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great place frienly staff all gated and safe.... only downfall is people pull up to gate threwout the night to get in and lay on the horn to get in the gate just to drop someone off and leave again.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We asked for a walke up call at 5 am and a cab to the airport.;0;0;0;0;0;0
At 4 am someone was laying on the horn to get into the gate only to drop some drunk guy off and leave...;0;1;0;1;0;0
Helpful staff and room was clean on arrival.;1;0;0;1;1;0
Did not get room made up for 2nd day but it worked out okay.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Older property that could stand updating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
it was great except for transportation cominghad to paid hotel for picking us updidnt no what shutter was going to be thereit was a mix up for sure.ONLY bad expericene was our phone in roomand keys had to keep getting program.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Excellent staying and very enjoyable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Walking distance to downtown Nassau and beaches i.e.Junkanoo;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was safe clean and the breakfast was good.;1;1;0;0;0;0
It had good bus connections.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The staff provided bottled water.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I boiled water from tap.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff did a great job.;0;0;0;0;1;0
no micowae in rooms  no coffeepot in rooms not enough towels;0;0;0;1;0;0
The staff is nice and friendly  what San Fun Resort is the hole in the wall in my room you can smell  Sewage  in the room coming from bathroom  toilet bowl loose on the floor .Now I see why there was 2 photos posted showing the bed  front of   Building .;1;0;0;1;1;0
I will NEVER stay there or  recommend to my friends or family;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel was normal the where friendly and the  bar was cool Breakfast was ok Old building;0;1;0;0;1;0
First room the bed wasn’t made hot water wasn’t working and the water smelled stagnant.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Could not sleep due to loud music and prostitues knocking at the door during the night.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Management refused to cancel my 2nd night as 1 hr 25 minutes over cancellation time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Please avoid.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This place is rough in every way.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We do not recommend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean sheets. .;1;0;0;0;0;0
Hair all over room bathroom not clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
And shower water smelt like sewage.;0;0;0;1;0;0
... You get the picture.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I stayed 3 nights on Friday and Saturday the music from their outdoor bar was so painfully loud I could not hear my TV and it went on until 2:00am.;0;0;0;1;0;0
After a number of people complained they turned it down on Sunday.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bring your money to buy food bread and coffee every morning is the breakfast they provide.;0;1;0;0;0;0
It is old and in need of a lot of repairs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was almost nothing.;0;1;0;0;0;0
worst hotel ever! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Frightening!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not comfortable with the neighborhood hotel or hotel staff.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Nothing seemed right.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotels.com or Expedia should not advertise and resale this hotel with misrepresented information.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needed a hotel for 1 night layover to go to Marsh Harbour next morning.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No front desk ...  hotel is old  dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Great location but rooms are pretty spartan no shampoo!;0;0;1;1;0;0
When you wait until the last minute to reserve a room for Parent's Weekend you don't have a lot of options.;0;0;0;1;0;0
This hotel was close to campus and clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
It's older and needs renovation and that seems to be happening at least a little.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We'd stay there again if our needs are good location and a low rate.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Last room in town and lucky to get it;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only place in 13 years of travel that has charged extra for traveling with a therapy dog -- and despite it being on the reservation they didn't charge at first -- they came after me later.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Place was filthy smelly and very noisy.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Staff were abrupt bordering on rude.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Restaurant next door is not open hasn't been for quite some time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We left at 4am -- couldn't stand the odor noise nor the cockroaches in the bathroom any longer.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The room smelled of mold and mildew;1;0;0;1;0;0
The room smelled  A/C poor- old window units  rooms not very cool.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Toliet seat loose and toilet did not flash.;0;0;0;1;0;0
suppose to have queen size bed-room had only a full size bed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
DID NOT STAY.;0;0;0;0;0;0
when to Natural Bridge  hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They did have a room available.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great accommadations there- but expedia said they did not have any availability.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was ok for 1 night but that's all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Place needs a good thorough cleaning.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Old and dated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Owners were very friendly and helpful :-;0;0;0;0;1;0
Cleanliness is not a priority here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would have been nice had the staff turned on the AC with a reservation.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Had they done so the room would not had been so stuffy and stinky.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But hey... cheap!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quite old and not taken care of that well.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean and the beds comfortable.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Ok for a night's stay but no longer.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good price though!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The price was excellent but so was the price at other places where I stayed during my trip.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The difference though was that this place was far inferior to the other places.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nothing major but a lot of little things limited number of TV channels bad reception on TV channels that were provided had to move to a different room because of a loose toilet seat the motel clerk was not particularly pleasant etc.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Staff was unbelievably patient with our late arrival due to traffic.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Bonus was every room has an outstanding mountain view!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Definetly recommend;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location right on the beach and in the centre of all activities.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Parking is available but a little complicated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful wellness retreat and a life altering experience;0;0;0;0;0;0
I recently spent 4 nights and days at Hackie’s in the Reef.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Since U live in northern New England my visit was a welcome relief from the frigid temperatures va k home!;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was pleasantly surprised by aspects of the location and package that were revealed once I began my stay.;0;0;1;0;0;0
From the variety of on-site massage/body treatments to the communal environment and personal attention of the owner my vacation was an amazing value!;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel option was a great getaway from the resort crowds during the holidays.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I enjoyed the personalized touch and the serene atmosphere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Jackie's on the reef is not the ideal option for the adventurous traveler since it's situated way out west with little to do near by.;0;0;1;0;0;0
However there are drivers to take you into town when needed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Recommended for an extended weekend yoga and spa retreat.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Yoga Centre is great if you're looking for peaceful beautiful surroundings away from the bigger complexes which can feel over crowded and full of kids.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Yoga classes are a great bonus and add to the experience.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Good ground for walking my dog.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good view of the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Property was very clean and well kept for an older property;1;0;0;0;0;0
convenient location to Nelson;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good spot for a one night stay on your way somewhere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Don't let the word 'resort' in the name fool you.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is an older motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The lady at reception was very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice and clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nice hotel close to lake and clean room kindly staffs.;1;0;0;1;1;0
Quick trip up.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Place was fine for the weekend and a convenient in between Ainsworth Hot Spring and the town of Nelson.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The people were wonderful and the beach and kayaking on the lake were awesome.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We will stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great place on the quiet outskirts of beautiful Nelson.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No pool or tub but lake and small beach across the road.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Guest lounging area is an elevated covered deck overlooking the grounds with bbq tables/chairs room also had kitchenette.;0;0;1;1;0;0
A great self-serv breakfast included.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room/bed just fine fullsize fridge/freezer.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Overall size is good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
the hosts served a great breakfast which included omelettes fruit fresh baked muffins etc.;0;1;0;0;0;0
stunning views quiet beach area - be careful crossing busy hwy 3A to get to the beach comfortable adirondack chairs and play area with bb hoop.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great just smokey from forest fires.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But nothing could take away the beauty! !;0;0;1;1;1;0
It's a heritage hotel filled with photos from the past.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms are all remodelled and very comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The included breakfasts are always wonderful - you won't need lunch!;0;1;0;0;0;0
The historical property is unique and is full of character beautifully renovated convenient...a superb experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The upgrade was appreciated so much...thank you!;0;0;0;0;0;0
All of staff are very frendly and professional.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Also location is good too.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The Hume is a great place to stay and reasonable rates!;0;0;0;0;0;0
AMAZING PLACE!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Absolutely beautiful and all the staff were very welcoming.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I have travelled a lot  staying at the Hume Hotel was by far one of the most positive experiences I have had.;0;0;0;0;0;0
What I liked the best were the free breakfasts  the 5 daily credit if you didn’t need the room cleaned on a daily basis.;1;1;0;1;0;0
The breakfast was a full meal  outstanding.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The daily room credit allowed us to buy the Chocolate Guinness cake from their Library Lounge restaurant which was outstanding too!;0;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel was centrally located and very nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was clean and bed comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
After a long day it was nice to have a tub large enough to soak in and a restaurant on property.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food was nothing fancy but good for the price and met our needs.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Quiet place and extremely friendly service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Would definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great hotel!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms are clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Restaurant was clean and staff was great  but the food was bland.;1;1;0;0;1;0
This place is very nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Many dining options.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We ate in the Library restaurant and it was both excellent and a great value.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The hotel has lots of character!;0;0;0;0;0;0
From the first arrival moment to the moment of departure from staffing to food quality inspired to return.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Great experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Convenient to everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely clean hotel with a really nice bar perfect for a quiet nightcap after exploring the town.;1;1;0;0;0;0
Unfortunately they apparently have a second bar which was right below our room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Loud music pumping kept us up until 2 am.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would stay here again but will request a room on the other side of the hotel!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Lovely historic hotel... rooms very nice.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff service was horrible.. from front desk to restaurants lounges..  cleaning lady was the only one that smiled acknowledged customers with a warm smile on the 4th floor.. massage was excellent however staff could put a bit more effort in there services... lack of parking... required to park on street and continue to fill meter every 2 hrs.. inconvenient and costly;0;0;0;0;1;0
We stayed in the presidental suite for our 25 th anniversary .;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was an amazing suite with great views and lovely furniture and decor.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Would stay again in a heart beat .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Terrific  friendly  informative staff and management.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Very romantic setting close to the lake and Nelson.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful grounds house and location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Has all the benefits of an hotel but with the luxury of a lovely home.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms are very comfortable and we were encouraged to enjoy large areas of the home which detail it`s unique history.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Blaylock's Mansion was just great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The house is so interesting and fun just to look around.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The grounds are equally nice and beautifully maintained.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely place to stay for views wow great style for accommodation;0;0;0;0;0;1
Beautiful mansion  stunning gardens  wonderful hosts  relaxing and peaceful.;0;0;0;0;0;1
1 night is definately NOT enough.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was our first time staying in a BB and the hosts made it well planned stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was beautiful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The male host was very knowledgeable of the history of the mansion and his wife was a very good cook.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only down side of the mansion was the heat.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is a very old place and they have no air conditioning no problem.;0;0;0;1;0;0
That does not take away the charm of this place and it's beautiful setting.;0;0;1;1;1;0
It is a must stay if you are in Nelson BC.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The manor is charming  breakfasts tasty and the hosts welcoming.;0;1;0;0;0;0
We had a great time on our stay here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hosts are wonderful and make an amazing breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Would highly recommend staying here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was such a treat to stay in an 85 year old mansion and to hear the history behind it and the walk up to the garden is beautiful and so peaceful!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Friendly staff and great location.;0;0;1;0;1;0
The hotel itself is very old but well kept and clean;1;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms were supper smallelectrical was pathetic.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No view.looking at brick wall.;0;0;0;0;0;0

A great spot to rest your head;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful downtown location with cool and very helpful staff;0;0;1;0;1;0

Good shower!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Window faces brick.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It's about where you are.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms clean enough but had a feel of just clean enough.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Staff not super welcoming.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It's not my favorite hotel in Nelson... the brick building doesn't give me a 'home' like feeling.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But then again what hotel does?;0;0;0;0;0;0
The parking isn't great.;0;0;0;0;0;1
With that being said super comfy rooms very clean and friendly staff.;1;0;0;1;1;0
Stayed here before would probably stay again if I'm pinching pennies!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needed to know about the stairs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I could do the flight of stairs  at 62 but I struggled with my suitcase and I noticed others did too.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Maybe mention on web site.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Close to Trafalgar Park and downtown.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very friendly service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Spacious well appointed clean reasonably modern good location would be happy to return;1;0;1;0;0;0
Have stayed here many time as a business traveller.;0;0;0;0;0;0
So know the place very well.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Is collecting a few nick nacks about the place which does make it a bit untidy or quirky.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But not much of an issue as the rooms are very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
spacious suite with balcony kitchen comfortably furnished walking distance to the town highlights  close to the main road for accessing the regional sights.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Great location and easy walk to restaurants and shopping.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Great staff was very nice rooms clean far prices close to everything;1;0;0;1;1;0
Decent hotel across the bridge from downtown Nelson.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Probably the best value hotel in Nelson nothing special but you get breakfast a comfy bed and cable for the night for the cheapest rate in town.;0;1;0;0;0;0
This was a family-owned property--a little tired looking but clean and the staff was very kind  helpful.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Although the attached restaurant was very busy usually a good sign we were disappointed in the food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Continental breakfast was very minimal.;0;1;0;0;0;0

Greg  and the sweet red headed gal went out of their way answering questions and generally made our stay more pleasant.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel was very run down.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The 'upgrades' I think were just new flooring.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was a hole in the wall where a fire alarm should have been and there was an awful odor in the room!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Motel is in easy walking distance to city centre shops  restaurants.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Great stay here for four nights close to Richmond and easy walking distance and close to the bike trail.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Customer service at the reception is below par.;0;0;0;0;1;0
These guys have no idea how to communicate with customers.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Okay stay however could be improved by providing bathroom supplies.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good off street parking and nice big room which was very clean and nicely furnished.;1;0;0;1;0;0
After a bit of confusion with pricing we were really happy with the facilities and location of the motel.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Nice clean friendly hotel rooms comfortable.;1;0;0;1;1;0
Good location;0;0;1;0;0;0
Was very basic and overpriced for what the facilities were.although we did not need to use the laundry they wanted you to pay 6.00 'really'.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We were asked if we wanted milk it should automatically be offered.;0;0;0;0;0;0
For the price it was good value for money.;0;0;0;0;0;1

Larger bedrooms but smaller living are.;0;0;1;1;1;0
Quite expensive for Richmond.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The owner - Chris - was just an outstanding and fun warm host who defined the best of our entire New Zealand experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We definitely recommend this place as both a great value and experience.;0;0;0;0;0;1

This hotel is not qualified to be on Expedia website;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean room near the beach and dirt cheap.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nothing to complain about here at all I’m not sure what some people expect for their money but dollar for dollar this was a killer deal.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Fairly reasonable price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Close to beach.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Often loud and rude guests.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They need to walk the halls at night and quiet loud guests.;0;0;1;0;0;0
the reception and front office is very bad;0;0;0;0;1;0
For a cheap hotel you get what you pay for usually.;0;0;0;0;0;1
This hotel is extremely clean for what you pay for and the room is actually a comfortable size.;1;0;0;1;0;0
If you're heading down to DJais and BarA with your squad pile in here because you're going to spend a million dollars at the bar and the cheap ubers from here and hotel price sorta help you out a little;0;1;0;0;0;0
Very pleased!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean rooms and pool;1;0;0;1;0;0
at 8am the breakfast was very light nothing to eat apart kellogs and if you don't like!;0;1;0;0;0;0
Over-priced dump.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Hallways were hot and stuffy plus they smelled of cigarette and marijuana smoke.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Room was shabby and un-inviting.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Front desk guy was on his cell the entire time I checked in.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Never been so close to walking away and driving home.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Also located on a dangerous stretch of road right on a busy circle with a lot of confused and agressive drivers.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Never again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very clean room and pool.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast sucked and was practically non-existent one morning.;0;1;0;0;0;0

The room was spacious and adequate for our needs.;0;0;0;1;0;0
no pool the ac didnt work the wall hole no breakfast;0;1;0;0;0;0
This place has potential.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms were spacious and I loved that there was no carpet.;0;0;0;1;0;0
On the flip side the beds were uncomfortable the Wi-Fi did not function properly and overall condition of the room was below par.;0;0;0;1;0;0
This hotel was not worth the money I paid for a Saturday night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hallways room dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Hair in bathroom and in bed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Freezer had no door one chair on balcony couldn't sit together drain in bathtub missing screws wouldn't hold in water.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No information on local activities or maps of area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Pool was covered and had no use of it with our stay which if I known that I wouldn't have stayed;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed here since I was running a race.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Thought it would be decent enough and close to Asbury Park.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Couldn't sleep all night before race since loud party in room above me.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Called front desk multiple times during night and no one answered.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Finally at 5:00 am front desk answered.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They removed the party but I didn't get any sleep.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room and halls were dirty hotel noisy all night.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Extremely uncomfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms needed to be cleaned better.. smelled like mildew pool needed  to be cleaned .. ac needed to be cleaned  out n fixed  .and most of all the drug trafficking  was horrendous along with the weed smell..;1;0;0;1;0;0
The rooms are nice and updated but the carpeting definitely needs replacing.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Otherwise the staff is friendly and helpful and the new pool is fantastic.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Good location in old town and close to Burriana beach.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Hotel clean  quiet.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Room was small but suitable for short stays.;0;0;0;1;0;0
the position of the hotel meant I was close to most amenities;0;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing staff and location great.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Also they afford help for you;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bathroom needed to be updated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The rest of the room was amazing.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Loved the view.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful view of the combo  the loft was extremely comfortable  had great amenities.;0;0;0;0;0;1

Could not fit electronics.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pillows small and uncomfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No TV in bedroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Not worth the price I payed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not what I expected.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Train at night was too loud.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Perfect vacation great people and lots to do everyday;0;0;0;0;0;0
Definitely thumbs up had the best 4th of July the resort includes park tickets which is a huge help we will definitely do this again can’t wait to come back.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Nice stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would be helpful to know when water park is not open;0;0;1;1;1;0
Resort grounds were nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I did not get the room with a balcony like was indicated when I booked the reservation.;0;0;0;1;0;0
In addition I was put in a handicapped room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I didn't complain since it was only one night and we spent the day at the water park and was only in the room late that night.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great place to stay during off season.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Super comfy beds nice and quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It was a pleasant surprise and glad we stayed;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was nice.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Close to the park.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I wish the weather would of cooperated;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel was a bit dated and still and now non smoking rooms once smoking still smell.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It's also a bit dark in the rooms but this place is really cool.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Still very much worth the visit.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great water park great staff great activities for kids;0;0;0;0;1;0
First room had lots of roaches in the bathtub.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Switched rooms and it was a bit better but very old and not too nice;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great staff simple room wonderful location.;0;0;1;1;1;0
Beautiful grounds;0;0;0;0;0;0
STAFF WAS GREAT VERY HELPFUL ROOMS WERE OLD AND NEED MUCH TLC.;0;0;0;1;1;0
CLEANING OF THE ROOM WAS HIT AND MISS.;1;0;0;1;0;0
ROACHES IN ROOM POOR SELECTION ON TV CHANNELS BELOW A HOTEL 6;0;0;0;1;0;0
First this place was called a resort is not even close to be a motel!;0;0;0;0;0;0
A train pass every hour at 50 ft from the rooms The water park resort look abandoned We were one of the only people there worse then a horror movie.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Stay away in offf season times it may be ok for locals to drink beer and drive you 4x4 but not to relax or travel here.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Also in the middle of the night we hear some screams that was fun in addition of the train noises.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We had a great time especially using the shuttle service going back and fourth to Wurst Fest.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Well-appointed and nicely situated on the Rutgers campus.;0;0;0;0;0;0
However could use better heat controls in the rooms..;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good price clean a bit dingy.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Felt like a dorm room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nothing wrong with that.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only access to food nearby was a student food hall.;0;1;1;0;0;0
The staff was personal and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They called back when I had questions in a timely manner.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location is perfect for a child attending Rutgers...especially on the Cook/Douglas campus.;0;0;1;0;0;0
My family has stayed there twice and we will again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The property was good - room was clean and front desk was great.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Some complimentary coffee would have been well received in the AM.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I booked two rooms at the same credit card I expected the two rooms to be close to each other one was on the first floor the other on the third floor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The person at the desk was not able to correct the problem.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No breakfast The corking around the bath tub was discovered deeds to be cleaned up or replaced;1;1;0;0;0;0
Staffs are friendly however the hotel is really outdated.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Need some updates!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very nice place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bed was not firm.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Air conditioning has limited settings.;0;0;0;1;0;0
However I was very happy with the place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff is very nice.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room is attractive.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Reasonable price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was very noisy in the morning you could hear everything that was going in the hallway.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Also while the washroom was fine it did leave something to be desired;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was very nice and at a super green location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We walked around and really enjoyed it.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I had a last minute change of plans and had to be in New Brunswick for a conference.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location was great.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was very quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only problem I had was that I was cold with the air conditioner and there way no way to change the temperature in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I look forward to staying there in the future.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They forgot to change the bed sheet and the pillow case.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I found a couple of hairs on the pillow and they smelled like sweat.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I could hear people walking around and talking in the hallway because of bad sound-proof.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was located right on Cook-Douglas campus.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you have a business at Rutgers it has a convenient location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
If not it is too far away from the downtown and the restaurants.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It has no amenity.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very boring place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean quiet place to stay I have stayed several times and probably will return.;1;0;0;0;0;0
It is convenient for me as I am a graduate student in Rutgers and my family lives two hours away from the university.;0;0;1;1;0;0
When I need to do work very early is convenient for me to stay with my baby and mom.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nicer and more reasonably priced than ALL others e.g.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Hampton Holiday etc.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was helpful and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room hallways and grounds were all clean and well kept.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Old property that needs a facelift.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice owner but office was locked until late in the second day.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hard to check out.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No breakfast served and pool was closed.;0;1;0;0;0;0
We didn’t stay room had extension cord with frig ang microwave running into the bathroom plug so you couldn’t shut bathroom door 3 extension cords for tv no ice machine pool was drained with dirt in deep end no one else there;0;0;0;1;0;0
We called to tell them that it would be a late check in nobody answered so we left a message.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Hotel was closed when we got there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No response from phone calls.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Had to go and find somewhere else to stay for the night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Expedia needs to update their info! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything is the same as before: comfortable and a practical choice.;0;0;0;0;0;1
However breakfast is no longer served unlike before.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The ads should be updated to reflect that.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent stay .;0;0;0;0;0;0
beautiful area nice people  clean comfortable rooms.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Pleasant employees and a nice breakfast.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Quiet area with alot to do all around.will definitely go back.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This hotel is so ugly and outdated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
!We asked for a room with either a queen or king bed but was told none of the rooms had anything bigger than a double.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room had an overwhelming musty smell.;1;0;0;1;0;0
If it hadn't been late and we hadn't been 3 hours from home we would driven home instead of staying here;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was nice the lobby was large and pleasant and the breakfast was good but the room was very old and smelly.;0;1;0;1;1;0
The curtain wand fell off when we tried to close them because the top of the curtain was torn.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The furniture was old and minimal and the carpet was old and dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It just smelled old and musty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I would not recommend it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was no Crown Plaza but I liked the price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
This hotel is in need of an update.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bed linens were clean but chair and carpet needed to be cleaned wicked!;1;0;0;1;0;0
Tolerable for a night or two.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Second stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great value compared to other accommodations in the vicinity.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This hotel is wonderful and surprisingly affordable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great food and shopping right in the premises and around.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The room is big super clean and the bed very comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Is it a bit out of the way?;0;0;0;0;0;0
Is it s bit outdated?;0;0;0;0;0;0
Are the rooms a bit on the musty side?;0;0;0;1;0;0
But is it a good value?;0;0;0;0;0;0
Answer to all above is yes.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good value for the berkshires.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needs some updates but heck --- if you want The Ritz then you probably shouldn't be reading the reviews for anywhere anyway.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was adequate and clean enough---just the minimum for one night and quiet enough to sleep.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The staff was exceptional and made up for the rather barren room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Not complaining just not recommending.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed here to attend a concert in Lenox MA.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was very easy to travel back and forth to the concert.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The motel was extremely clean and the staff was very helpful.;1;0;0;0;1;0
The motel is a little older but the price was more than fair considering the time of year and the location of the facility.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Definitely would stay again if in the area!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Not looking for anything special just a good night's sleep while on the road.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Friendly and responsive staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Basic room but all the necessary needs including free wi-fi .;0;0;0;1;0;0
Would stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I stayed for one night it was decent for the night .. Was a little dirty around the edges and the tv didn't work by boyfriend had to pull the dresser out to fix the plugs also there was an old odor masked by a harsh cologne coming in.;1;0;0;1;0;0
rooms were as shown on site.;0;0;0;1;0;0
caretaking staff.gud location.;0;0;1;0;1;0
nearby shopping centre.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Too many mosquitoes in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Tried killing but they keep on coming.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Night staff very unhelpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Check in nearly impossible in the early hours.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Unknown charges applied.;0;0;0;0;0;0
More expensive than a 5* down the road.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very basic.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Day time staff more helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Breakfast!! !;0;1;0;0;0;0
The original booking was for an executive level room - unfortunately it overlooked a very busy road which was noisy for most of the night.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But that’s New Delhi!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Definitely go for the cheaper ‘deluxe room’ without the street view - you’ll get a much better night.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room wasn't clean when I reached.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Had to call the housekeeping staff to clean it.;1;0;0;0;1;0
No TV channels coming.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Overall below average hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were 'upgraded ' the manager told us !;0;0;0;0;1;0
We were shown a medium sized room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
One flush the toilet bowl started leaking .;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was no hot water .;0;0;0;0;0;0
After we complained we were given a bucket of warm water - for two people to have a wash.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was noisy and the air conditioner added to the noise .;0;0;0;1;0;0

Have some comparison with other hotels in India and well .......  there is no comparison :;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is a standard 3 star hotel NOT a boutique hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Worst is the restarant service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
20 minutes to have a bottle of water delivered to the table 45 minutes for food to arrive but most concrening is hygiene my waiter cleaned my knife by running it between his fingers!;1;1;0;0;0;0

Good for short business visits will not recommend for family/ pleasure.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Disappointing - window did not look out just a dark corridor - delux room - managed to kill 3 insects over 4 nights bathroom not clean- shower curtain dirty - bath towels were sticky - my husband and i had serious doubts whether they were washed.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Shall not be going back.;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was very close to the train station and metro stations as well.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room was good and well maintained.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The staff were so amazing friendly and they do their best to help.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Just minutes away from the many good supermarkets and many good selection of restaurants around the neighborhood.The bedroom was pretty nice and the beds were comfortable.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The staff of this hotel were all really great and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Decent hotel  value for money.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Heater was provided before we checked in at no extra cost.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Toilet flush was a problem.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Comforter cover was not a fresh one  it was clearly used one.;0;1;1;1;1;0
They did not have a fresh one  hence removed the dirty cover and asked us to use the comforter without cover.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast offered was good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room service was quick and good.;0;0;0;1;1;0
decent staff and overall satisfactory stay for two nights with family.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I have used this hotel in the past it is handy and convenient  for New Dehli Railway station  condition is fair  for the price charged   service was good and seemed to be no problem  I would use it again;0;0;1;0;1;0
Overall a decent and comfortable stay.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It can be noisy in the streets outside but it settles down by 10 pm onwards.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Lots of places to eat around and the food is available at the hotel too.;0;1;0;0;0;0
My hotel arranged for a taxi to the airport at reasonable price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wake up call available in the morning.;0;0;0;0;0;0
very bad experienceworst in my life for hotel staying.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel.com should not recommend such hotels as its reputation will be irred in costomer.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I had to change my room after first jsem night.The shower wasn't working and toilet was far too close to the wall.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It wasnt clean when I've come and sheets needed to be changed.;1;0;0;0;0;0
All by all very bad experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff where helpful .;0;0;0;0;1;0
Busy narrow st with lots of hotels and tourist facilities for booking tours .;0;0;0;0;0;0
3rd room was without bugs.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very noisy.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not recommended.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was dirty to begin with.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The toilette was broken and the bed not cleaned.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel itself was in a run down area of the town in a dirty side street with other similar shady hotels.;1;0;1;0;0;0
DO NOT STAY HERE!! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Frankly speaking the hotel staff were better than the room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The room was small and compact.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No enough space to move around.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hot water supply on demand was available in wash room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
TV and phone were also available.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The room is not suitable for people going with their spouse because you can hear all conversation from outside because of enough gap for ventilation right on the top of the main door.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good hotel to stay especially for a single visits.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was smaller than what was shown in the photos.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But will give it  a good rating as the staff was very helpful and the place was clean.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Hence good value for the money.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Overall happy with stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's a very basic hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Facilities are older but that adds to the charm.;0;0;0;0;0;0
no shampoo no shower gel no desk but quite and clean staffs are nice;1;0;0;1;1;0
Right in the thick of things next to the Yale campus and has a fun vintage lobby.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But the room was literally falling apart.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Mismatch furniture sagging floors ancient bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Crack in ceiling.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely hotel about to be renovated and possibly spoilt.;0;0;0;0;0;0
for a pleasant history lesson in what a smart hotel felt like in the 50s book now.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is not a modern but a quaint hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Any shortcoming is more than compensated by its amazing location - next door to Yale.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I don't have any complaints: internet works well staff friendly room is comfortable and clean.;1;0;0;1;1;0
The price is pretty reasonable too.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is a good alternative to other more expensive/modern hotels in New Haven.;0;0;0;0;0;0
nice clean room.;1;0;0;1;0;0
oldest operator-assisted elevator in CT--that wasn't working in the morning.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But still quaint as can be.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Hotel is very run down.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needs to be spruced up a LOT.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice historical hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to the Yale University which is convenient for visiting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I told my wife the Duncan was 'shabby/chic':  on seeing it she said 'except for the chic part.';0;0;0;0;0;0
But we were comfortable enough for three nights and close to everything we wanted.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The only reason why I stay here is due to its proximity to Yale it is very dirty TV does not work and pricey for what you get;1;0;0;1;0;0
Old fashion and small no frills hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But very clean and friendly.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Comfortable bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice place if you just need a place to sleep conveniently located.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I came to New Haven to drop off my child at Yale.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel was perfect for that in terms of location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I walked but I understand the Yale shuttle stops nearby to take you to the campus.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Hotel itself is old.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Manned elevator operates from around 9am till late evening so if you're on 5th fl like us you will get a nice workout.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was very accommodating my parents stayed there they speak only little English and the staff made it possible for them to have all they needed.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Love the closeness to Yale University and visiting my son.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room is a bit dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Dust everywhere  trash in the trashcan when I arrived  door lock is falling off.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Place needs work.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Basic accommodations in a good location with friendly staff.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Dirty and dated.;1;0;0;0;0;0
You also might be waiting outside surrounded by bugs waiting to check in if you get there in the evening.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This place was made for hookers and Johns not anyone who wants a good nights sleep and a shower in the morning.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Older property worn and beat up but safe and quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Friendly and chill desk clerk.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room clean but worn.;1;0;0;1;0;0

The person there was nice to give us a key to look at room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
well it was  extremely dated and smelled so bad I had to tell them I couldn't stay the smell was so bad and flies in bathroom.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Unfortunately I lost 54 because no refund.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would take this off your site.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's  embarrassing ! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Could not stay  way to dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Motel across street was 40.00 dollars and very clean but old.;1;0;0;0;0;0

Spacious and homy as we stayed in the spa suite.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Everything was good except WiFi was a little bit weak.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The ability to have a separate lounge area and another dining area AND another area to eat takeaway was fantastic.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Next time we wont bother to stay in Hobart.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very comfortable and run as we would.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Experience not good;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was a staging post en route for Hobart and it met our needs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything cluttered with frills doilies cushions which compromised available space for luggage etc.;0;1;1;1;1;0
overall good to stay;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed one night in a family room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Clean and comfy and close to Mt Field National Park.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Good communication clean  comfortable  accommodation convenient location  ok continental breakfast.;1;1;1;0;0;0
Wonderful fresh fruit berries and cherries  and superb locally grown stewed fruits were a real treat for breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Located in a quiet area guaranteed a great sleep.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Access to dining rooms lounge complementary port laundry/ kitchen was ideal.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Hosts were friendly informative generous and we thoroughly enjoyed our weeks stay.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We liked the sound of Rosie's Inn and were not disappointed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rose theme was fun even though Rosie was wearing poppies when we were there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Contact with hosts is always appreciated and being able to talk gardens with them and explore their grounds was interesting.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We especially loved the black mulberry tree.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wish they had  phone.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Liked courtyard.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Front desk was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not enough coffee;0;1;0;0;0;0
The location is perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It is not ritzy but a good price and is comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Great location!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Terrific service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Good WIFI.;0;0;0;0;0;0

We stayed in New Orleans at the French Quarter for one night and this location is very well appointed.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Close enough to everything and yet in a really quiet section of the quarter.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great place in the quiet section of the French Quarter.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Noon checkout for relaxing vacations and they held my luggage so I could enjoy my last day.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Across the street from amazing croissoint and coffee place.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Super close to Verti Marte the all night sandwich place Central Grocery and the rock and roll bars with lots of locals Aunt Tikis The Abbey and Santos.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Small simple reasonable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect for our needs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you are looking for something near the action and walk-able but not in the middle of the madness this is the place for you.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Front desk staff super nice and accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We enjoyed our stay in New Orleans.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We arrived a little early and because our room was ready we were able to have an early check in.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was parking just outside so we didn't have to worry about parking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only negative thing I have about our stay was the noise from the room above.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My suggestion is to get a second floor room if you can.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice clean quiet central.;1;0;1;0;0;0
Would stay here again;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good stay only issue was the free parking was in a garage about 5 blocks away from the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I am a older woman and had to walk the blocks by myself.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Stayed for the weekend again and per usual my stay was comfortable and fun.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Charming place perfect location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nice hotel .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Within walking distance of Bourbon Street and the French Market;0;0;1;0;0;0
Historic hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nothing modern in it but great ambiamce.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Keep in mind it is an old hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was nice that it was an all adult hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff is friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
However it needs a little more deep cleaning.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Dust in places that probably contributes to the old smell.;1;0;0;0;0;0
But once you hit the streets those smells over ride the one in the room.;1;0;0;1;0;0
You tend to forget about it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Loved the bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I haven't slept like a baby in a long time!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Overall good experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed in this hotel because it is right in the middle of the French quarter and was a good deal.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It is a clean and quiet spot perfect as a homebase to rest up at in between excursions to Bourbon street.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Great stay would come again in a heartbeat.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quietest hotel stay even though it's right in the heart of the action.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Great place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only complaint is my iron was leaking water so I had to iron with no steam.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very unique and comfortable room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Super friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great location;0;0;1;0;0;0

the room was amaizing ♥️;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very comfortable clean and spacious 1 bedroom loft;1;0;0;0;0;0
We did not enjoy our stay at this hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Long story but we were given a room with no windows and a dirty shower.;1;0;0;1;0;0
They moved us to a somewhat better room but it took more than a day and the bathroom new needed cleaning before we would occupy it.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Desk staff and concierge were not knowledgeable about the area or helpful in any way.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Location was great but that’s not enough for us to recommend this property.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great location with amazing Nee Orleans flair and personality.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I would highly recommend!;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was perfect for what we needed.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Very clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was very helpful and polite.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We did not enjoy our stay at this hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms are dark and not very clean the hotel clerks were not knowledgeable about the area and the 4 different concierges we talked to had to google answers to the questions we asked something we could have done ourselves of course.;1;0;1;1;1;0
Location is great conveniently to the French quarter bourbon street and the trolley.;0;0;1;0;0;0
However I do not recommend this property.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We will stay elsewhere next time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was beautiful spacious  comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Amazing hotel... we'll go out of our way to stay here again!! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
My reservation was canceled on arrival day I don't believe in explanation that pipe broke.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My husband and I were there for 4 nights.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I did not want a typical hotel so I chose Blue/Green.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We loved the condo with the art work and of course the separate bedroom.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was the neatest place ever and I like that we had a private entrance from the street.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We just loved it and I have told all my friends about it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great staff day and night.;0;0;0;0;1;0
What a great place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location was perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Bed was very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I will definately stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very impressed with hardwood floors and tall ceilings of this apartment style condo.;0;0;0;0;0;1
A great location to enjoying shopping eating out and taking the sites of the area on foot.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Hope to go back again some day.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Get hotel for the price and in a great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Friendly and informational staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Only about 5 blocks from bourbon st. and a short cab ride from Frenchman st.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Perfect location on the outskirts of the FQ at Canal  Decatur.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We have always stayed at the Marriott just adjacent to this hotel and I loved that location but this was so much more cozy.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was excellent room had a sitting area partial kitchen bathroom with a huge shower and a nice sized bedroom.;0;0;1;1;1;0
We will definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location of the hotel was on a great street - close enough to all the action but far enough to avoid the noise.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We loved the decor of the hotel and loved how quaint our room was!;0;0;0;1;0;0
I cannot say enough about the staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0

As a women traveling alone it really helped to have such a nice place to stay. Thanks;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was small and housekeeping was nonexistent.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Location was great!;0;0;1;0;0;0
If you are looking for and paying for an above average room this is not the place.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I’ve and quiet and I like the seating area next to the pool;0;0;1;0;0;0
We stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was pleasant especially at the rate we booked it in.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The breakfast is not the best but convenient.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I would definitely book it again if I'm ever in the New Orleans area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Even though room was paid they will still charge you a 75 deposit that they tell you will refunded bavk to add after checkout when maid service states no damages to room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
I'm still waiting on refund;0;0;0;0;0;0
It has big room big enough to accomodate my family i have 2 kids 9years and 6 years with big parking lot.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I parked my car just in front of my room super easy for me to load and unload my stuffs;0;0;0;1;0;0
So it is a nice hotel but the breakfast  is realy optinal in one day it just didnt hapen;0;1;0;0;0;0

I did let the front desk know and they responded by saying the room was converted into two rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
which still didnt explain why the tv didnt work.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The location is terrible the room was dirty and the people from the front desk where kind of rude.;1;0;1;1;1;0
Very old and filthy.;1;0;0;0;0;0

Unique property comprised of 5 historic homes combined to make over 40 charming and one-of-a-kind guest rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There are interesting things to see everywhere you look from the lobby to rooms to rooftop terrace to courtyard.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The 2 resident cats add to the homey feel of this distictive property in the heart of the French Quarter.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Staff was very accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Hotel gave us an upgrade to accommodate our personal needs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very close to French Quarter.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Third floor with no working elevator.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No pool.;0;0;0;0;0;1

Each room is unique and the history is pretty cool too.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The staff was friendly and the room was large with a great New Orleans feel to it.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The pool and outside were closed due to reinventions and they gave us a great discount.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only areas that were air-conditioned where the actual guest rooms and ours had a window unit.;0;0;1;1;0;0
It was great that the hotel offered free bottled water.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you are looking for a New Orleans feel just a block off Bourbon street this is your hotel.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Even though they are going through construction the hotel was lovely.;0;0;0;0;0;0
You feel apart of New Orleans when you stay here more so than a big hotel chain.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was so amazing and welcoming.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room was exactly what we needed.;0;0;0;1;0;0

John and all the staff made certain that our stay was everything we wanted it to be.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The history and charm stole our hearts.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The workmen who are working on fire damaged areas took time to give us a tour.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We have already booked our next visit! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is an antebellum mansion with great charm and character.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is in a very convenient location with easy access to Bourbon Street.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The staff was very friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
If you are over 6 feet tall make sure to ask for a room with tall ceilings.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My loft sleeping area had ceilings about 6 feet high and I’m 6’3”.;0;0;1;0;0;0

I would stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Hotel room was genuinely impressive - modern and well built with a fantastic view of the gardens below.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff were lovely.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Only complaint is it was a touch hard to find but that may have been my inability to follow a GPS.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was lovely spending a few days at Burgees Hill I love how it looks out to native bush and a river and how you can see Mount Egmont at the top of the driveway.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A hidden getaway only 7mins drive from town.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I will definitely be back :;0;0;0;0;0;0

Beautiful views of river and bush lovely hosts and clean modern rooms with all the facilities you need and more.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Just love the spa bath.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I enjoy staying at One Burgess Hill because of the peace and tranquility yet its only a few minutes drive to the middle of town.;0;1;1;1;1;0
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at One Burgess Hill the setting is quite unique very private  the river below adds another level to peace  tranquility;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location and property was excellent.;0;0;1;0;0;0
You must have a car or any form of transport.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Being summer there were lots of flies.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The unit was very clean but being semi-bush it was expected.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The signboard on the road frontage should be lighted as it is easy to miss the turn off.;0;0;0;0;0;0
All was well with our two day stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Superb location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Fantastic Accommodation just 5 minutes from the city boundaries.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff were helpful but not overly so.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was a wedding venue private and warm on a cold day and we were outside.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice comfortable rooms and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
One of guests required ambulance staff were very helpful organising and getting guest to a private room and basic first aid.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Amazing staff and a unique stay.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Our Room was upgraded as Expedia seemed to have miscomunicated with the hotel.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But the hotel made sure we had got the room I had booked.;0;0;0;1;0;0
A little gem in the heart of Taranaki.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Fab stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
What a great place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff friendly and we felt very welcome and enjoyed our evening meal in the restaurant.;0;1;0;0;1;0

Some features in our suite weren't quite on the mark -- lack of a top-sheet on the bed mini-bar not fully stocked large bathroom was cold but warmed up nicely with requested portable heater.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Free Netflix was nice touch.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Available free bicycles were a bit sorry tho' -- we ended up taking hire bikes from a nearby shop.;0;0;1;0;0;0
So overall very good but not full marks.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Fascinating decor with lots of special touches.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Sherry and Port nook wth library.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Lots of fresh flowers.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pleasant outdoor area for sitting and eating.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Handy city position near the sea and parks.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Excellent restaurant with interesting menue.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Terry Dan and Rachel  deserve a special mention for going beyond the call of duty.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was an enjoyable stay quirky and interesting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
With a few unique aspects that make it stand out from other.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very comfortable room and cozy hotel to stay.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Close to the sea to watch a romantic sunset and various resturants within walking distance including what looked like a 5 star eatery at the hotel.;0;0;1;0;0;0
A lively hotel situated conveniently in New Plymouth greatly in need of a spring clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Rather overpriced.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The room was clean  more than accommodated our family of 4.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Clean and tidy old school motel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The room smelled a little but overall it suited our purpose.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Short drive in to town.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Note that there is no spa just a hot indoor pool but will leave you smelling strongly of chlorine.;1;0;0;0;0;0

Nice and spacious with all the necessities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only downfall was that there is only 1 bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
For a 3 bedroom motel unit there should be at least separate bathroom and toilet or an ensuite.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We went for a concert and the location was perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We were close to town too and were advised to use a great fish and chip shop grab and co. Well equipped apartment plenty of room and would be more than happy to stay again.;0;0;0;1;0;0

The photos are mis-leading though.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It must be for a deluxe room and not a Standard room which we got and which was much smaller.;0;0;0;1;0;0
This is our second stay at the Standard.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room is fairly small as is typical of NYC but there is still plenty of space to be comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It is clean quiet and staff is fantastic from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff.;1;0;0;0;1;0
We will continue to return.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Carpeting and drapes.;0;0;1;1;1;0
in room were badly stained.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Hotel needs some refurbishing;0;0;0;0;0;0
Check in was easy service was excellent.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We ordered room service and the food was incredible.;0;1;0;1;1;0
The volume of the restaurant three floors below us came up through the elevator shaft but was muted enough to be tolerable and didn’t keep us from sleeping.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Slept the best here than we have at other hotels.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I think I was placed in a wheelchair accessible room which felt odd shower was really exposed hooks were all low.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The air conditioner broke but they were able to fix it immediately which was great!;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bed was really worn out which was unfortunate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location was the best! !;0;0;1;0;0;0
Perfect location for this visit ... and ambience was wonderful;0;0;1;0;0;0
I loved the casual yet professional and friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room was well appointed  The cafe served a proper breakfast with a smile.;0;1;0;1;0;0
I love this hotel and have stayed there on my last 4 trips to NYC!;0;0;0;0;0;0
My daughter is a student at NYU and the hotel is in an awesome location for us: convenient to campus and also to great restaurants and the subway to get around the city.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms are super-updated and clean and best of all the staff is always friendly and ready to help in any way!;1;0;0;1;1;0
It will continue to be our go-to hotel in NYC!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms were clean and well thought out.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Comfortable bed shower and other amenities.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My husband and I had a wonderful experience at The Standard.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location was perfect and the bed was very comfortable.;0;0;1;0;0;0
They have davines products in the rooms which is awesome.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bar and restaurant area were also really fun!;0;1;1;0;0;0
The staff was super helpful and accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I would definitely stay at this hotel again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Highly recommend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Lots to do around the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My complaint is that I thought the corner room was like the picture shown on my confirmation.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was truly disappointed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Is that the Hotel doing that or is it Orbitz?;0;0;0;0;0;0
Maybe it should show a picture of the room you are booking or no picture at all.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Again I was very disappointed by this—I travel very little and maybe just not aware of how things are done—I felt duped.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location for Cooper Square.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Small rooms but otherwise excellent;0;0;0;1;0;0
Booked this room for a weekend away at the city.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pros: The hotel is close to everything one might need — cafes food bars shops.;0;1;0;0;0;0
It’s in a good location that didn’t feel too touristy too!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Close to mass transit.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Cons: no coffee pot or microwave in the room mini-bar in hotel room outrageously over priced but had some nice items.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Perfect location / helpful and friendly staff / great views from room;0;0;1;1;1;0
Cute hotel with friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We had a king size bed on the 5th floor that didn't have a view - just of the side of a brick building.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms are clean and small but that's expected in NYC.;1;0;0;1;0;0
I'd probably stay there again for a lower price or try out their other one in Chelsea.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very pleasant facility.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice restaurant/bar right next door.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Nice outdoor café for breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Many good East Village restaurants within an easy walk.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Subway station 0.2 miles.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Easy walk to Washington Square.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We generally like to stay down in the Village away from the hustle and bustle of Time square.;0;0;1;1;0;0
The room itself was very comfortable fantastic view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I would definitely go back again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A modern very cool hotel in a great location in the East Village.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It's close to subway stations nice restaurants and interesting shops.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I'll stay elsewhere next time;0;0;0;0;0;0
there was no coffee maker no microwave no refrigerator.;0;1;0;1;0;0
not even coffee available n the offce.;0;1;0;0;0;0
not worth the money charged for ths room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
only good thng the bed was comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It’s just an average motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I have no complaints on any front.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good overall value price wise and the room was clean and bed comfy.;1;0;0;1;0;0
No amenities to speak of but none expected.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Just a place to crash whilst visiting family for the day.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It’s okay for that.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is the 2nd time that I've stayed here since 2000.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They could use some updates and they need to make sure all the rooms have 2 sets of towels not just body towels.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Convenience and friendly staff price was excellent and I felt safe during my stay.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Old but quite.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room not cleaned during a 2 night stay towels not replenished old soap pieces left in the tub ...;1;0;0;1;0;0
But in an area where nightly rates exceed 125 you get more or less what you pay for.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The manager was friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Unfortunately the bathroom floor had mold growing and the whole bathroom smelled.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The bed was very uncomfortable and the springs squeaked every time I moved.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not a lot of accommodating wouldn’t stay here again felt it could have been better;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nothing fancy but clean and convenient.;1;0;0;0;0;0
A little too expensive for what you get.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Just a place to lay your head.;0;0;0;0;0;0
That's it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Money was demanded at check in.;0;0;0;0;0;1
got there late.;0;0;0;0;0;0
room smelled;1;0;0;1;0;0
good venue for shows at the Civic Theatre but otherwise a disappointing experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room fine but no on site parking no staff on Sunday afternoons hotel locked and accessed via a locked door with a room key dining room experience not tested as seldom open for business.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sn overnight event in Newcastle resulted in us staying at the Clarendon.;0;1;1;1;1;0
While the room could have been cleaner the location and price were great.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Unfortunately the hotel has also a pub and a beer garden.;0;1;0;0;0;0
On the night I stayed the beer garden was rented out for a function which lead to extreme noise from a music band until 11.20 pm.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Great location and well presented except for the following issues: 1.;0;0;1;0;0;0
A/C too cold and cannot be turned up 2.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not enough blankets on bed 3.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Smell in pillow pillow slips are clean;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nice hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
clean convinient and not costing too much.;1;0;0;0;0;0
nice location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good size room clean great location.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Will stay again;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was very hard to find because of the light rail.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was disappointed that I had NO hot water on Saturday night;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice Hotel good location;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only complaint we had was there was not enough tea in our room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
We asked for more teabags and received TWO;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great place to stay especially if you have an event at the Civic Theatre which I did.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Parking was the issue but not the Hotels fault.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Restaurant food was great.;0;1;0;0;0;0
People all very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We really only had one issue.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was lots of coffee but only three teabags.;0;1;0;0;0;0
We asked for some more the next morning and they bought two up saying they have run out.;0;0;0;0;0;0
That was a bit disappointing as we couldn’t have a cup of tea in the morning as we only had one teabag between two;0;1;0;0;0;0
Lovely hotel within close walking proximity to nice restaurants and locations.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Shame that the light rail project has closed all of Hunter street down for the time being and it is difficult to navigate around due to all of the closures.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff of the hotel/pub were wonderful and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Would come back!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel staff went above and beyond to help me with my luggage in the morning.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room service was always prompt.;0;0;0;1;1;0
I probably wouldn't stay here again until the light rail works are complete and there is more parking close-by.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent location friendly service and comfortable.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Parking could possibly be a issue and minimal area to hang your towel.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This is a great hotel in the heart of Newcastle.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is walking distance to plenty of restaurants bars and landmarks of Newcastle.;0;1;1;0;0;0
It's also close to numerous bus stops great bus system in Newcastle imo.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The free WiFi was surprisingly strong.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would definitely stay in this facility if I'm back in Newcastle.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very well presented room in very central location.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Spacious and very clean and well appointed.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Room very quiet this night Friday.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Had a lovely overnight stay at this hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean friendly and the food was delicious;1;1;0;0;1;0
Always clean good security.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nice it has pool and jucuzzi;0;0;0;0;0;0
We love the price and discount from aaa that they have  and that they are pet friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
we were very unhappy as they don’t provide WiFi and if they do they charge a extra fee ☹️ But overall was ok the experience;0;0;0;0;0;0
i stay here often.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Easy in easy out.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Convenient to local coffee shopping food without the higher price of a similar hotel closer to the hub of this rural community with mostly blue skies everyday.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Scratchy towels 1-ply TP.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Fridge didn’t work.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Could have used some sort of guide for the TV Listings.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was visiting my wife in Malibu is a great little hotel for the price and the housekeeping staff was amazing  thanks dew;0;0;0;0;1;0
Overall my stay was relaxing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I had a small problem with my first room but the staff had no problem accommodating me with another room.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The staff are always working on the property to ensure it is maintained s and hospitable.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice looking property with pool.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Wifi did not work in my room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very rude office staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Accused me of being the bad guy when I complained about their service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This a great place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff and reasonable rates.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Food market on the lot as well as other shopping and services.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is fine for the money.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My room appeared clean bed was comfortable and AC was cool and shower hot.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It is not an upscale hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is a place you stay for sleep and value.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing Staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The TV and WiFi are good.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My stay was great there!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was friendly and easy to talk always eager to help.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I will be coming back.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I had a relaxing stay clean and peacefull thanks;1;0;0;0;0;0
Off the freeway but could not hear the traffic from my room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Way too hot not to have working ice maker.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Travelers need ice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Once is ok. Two  weeks later and still no icemaker is inexcusable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Profits over service is sad;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was a very pleasant stay at Premier Inns.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very friendly and helpful staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Rooms very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
No issues with hot water and shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Clean towels.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Overall it was a very good stay for the price we paid and on our next visit we definitely want to stay at this place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Dirty noisy.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very rude reception.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Not recommended!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room super romantic.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Food and service wonderful.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Lovely facilities and great service overall!;0;0;0;0;1;0
We enjoyed the girls get together very much!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food at Coliseum and Grill was delicious.;0;1;0;0;0;0
What a resort!;0;0;0;0;0;0
We opted for the ocean view bungalow so cozy and inviting.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Loved that we could park right outside our bungalow.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Will definitely be back as we come annually!;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was our first visit to Pelican Hill Resort.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We loved our visit and plan to return when we are in that area again.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Thank you for a great experience. :;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great view of the ocean and sunset.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Too spread out walking from room to hotel activities really is not well thought out.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Not much in the way of activities for children besides the pool.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not family friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Expect to pay too much.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Coffee can be found 1/2 mile from your room in the morning small coffee with tip and tax will cost you 5.00 Not built as a hotel more of a wedding or Corporation meeting location.;0;1;1;1;0;0
It is a first class hotel and well worth the price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
If you have a car that makes things a little easier - getting them to pick you up and take you to the resort takes some time - walking or your own car is the better solution!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Beautiful resort with very poor beach access - the beach is 3 -4 miles away and must be reached by shuttle.;0;0;1;1;1;0
The beach is dirty and undesirable!;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very disappointed in what we booked as an ocean view room that ended up being a tree and rooftop view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
resort is great  but across highway from ocean  service is not great at the pool;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was a nice  close getaway.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very peaceful and elegant.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice for a quick recharge from the LA hustle.;0;0;0;0;0;0
for that what they charge  not getting at all  and overcharge everything in the resort  you would spend another daily charge easy  just even by the pool ocean view kidding  we saw  mostly next line of bungalows roof or plants specially cloudy day  not even line of the ocean .;0;0;0;0;0;1
Wonderful facilities and the golf is extraordinary!;0;0;0;0;0;1
The staff are extremely helpful and courteous.;0;0;0;0;1;0
However they like to charge for parking which doesn't make since because you basically park at your front door.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our experience at Pelican Hill was fabulous right from the start.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite..with a view of the ocean.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The accommodations were beautiful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Side note:The bedding was amazing!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Loved the breakfast by the pool as well.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This property rates high for luxury amazing staff and incredible location...can't wait to come back!;0;0;1;0;1;0
It was great stay except for the weather.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food was great at the Golf club but room service food was not recommendable.;0;1;0;1;1;0
It also include little too high tip of 22  delivery fee.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wonderful stay at a great property.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will be back for sure.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our bath would not drain after taking a bath had to call service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room charges on my bill were strange I was charged twice each day for room tax and cta fee.?;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was also charged  20.00 room charge at the Coliseum restaurant were I had dinner with friends and paid with a credit card .;0;0;0;1;0;0
I also thought that  52.87 was over the top for breakfast for two at the Coliseum;0;1;0;0;0;0
I have been to the Pelican Hill Resort 5 times and each time I return I can only say wow.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bungalows overlooking the ocean are spectacular.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The grounds are maintained to Disney standards.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast at the Pavilion overlooking the infinity pool golf course and ocean can't be matched anywhere in the U.S.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The staff was lovely accommodating and friendly..;0;0;0;0;1;0
We were staying there for a weekend celebrating my husbands birthday.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had an amazing time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Highly highly recommend this hotel!;0;0;0;0;0;0
At Check in I wasn't told that I  had no breakfast with my room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
The room they gave me at 1st had only a shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Then I got anther room with a bath tub at had some else hair in the tub.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great hotel!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will definitely return.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great staff clean and close to shopping and restaurants.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Nice hotel and great staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Clean room and the Bistro has great food and drinks!;1;1;0;1;0;0
My stay was exceptionally wonderful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was very helpful as well as welcoming and friendly..;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room was magnificent newly up to date very spacious and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel is walking distance to the Mall as well as near by amenities..;0;0;1;0;0;0
I give this hotel 2 thumbs up and will definitely be stying again..;0;0;0;0;0;0
I'm never disappointed in my stays at Marriott's! ! ;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely property in convenient location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great staff and nice grounds.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice outside fire pit for sitting around with a drink on a warm night.;0;1;0;0;0;0
No free breakfast but snack food  coffee available for purchase.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Nice and new staff was professional  great location to freeway mall and restaurants;0;0;1;0;1;0
It was a great stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Bistro was great and the people were super friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The rooms are so pretty and functional.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The shower was enormous.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bed was very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice staff;0;0;0;0;1;0
Everything was great!;0;0;0;0;0;0
My son stationed In Newport News and we visit him to celebrate his birthday.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We stayed in Courtyard by Marriott and that was Nice hotel in quite zone.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to everything and tucked away from noises.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pleasant ladies Starr served us great blueberry ricotta pancakes with coffee for fee.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Everyone in Hotel  were great!!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only one thing I will correct is coffee.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Even “strongest  darkest” coffee was weak. Thanks ;0;1;0;0;0;0
Hotel was very clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
All the staff was very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Would definitely recommend!!! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Orbitz listed that free newspaper was included...it was not  No continental breakfast although room price was at least 175 after taxes per night.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Room  Trashcan was not emptied the first night of my stay and housekeeper also failed to replenish coffee supply for room after first night.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Front desk attendant was very helpful and courteous.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Not the best deal for money spent however.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed one night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very close to the airport which was convenient for my friends picking me up.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wished there was a shuttle on the weekend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was easy to get to from the airport and the staff were very helpful in checking us in and letting us know what the hotel lobby offered.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The rooms were clean and spacious and allowed my wife and I to relax and enjoy our vacation.;1;0;0;1;0;0
We would definitely use this hotel chain for future travels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
You need new mattresses comfortersand pillows!!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Call the ithaca courtyard marriot and ask them where they got theirs b/c you need new ones badly! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Upon arrival I was informed breakfast was not included.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The room was dusty especially around coffeemaker  countertop.;1;0;0;1;0;0
I called front desk housekeeper came with cleaning cloth in her pocket to wipe down area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Another day the area wasn't cleaned nor was the sink cleaned.;1;0;1;0;0;0
There was hair left in sink  shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was told the housekeeper from a temp service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The hotel is not new but has great friendly and accommodating front desk housekeeping and general staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
During our visit the bar ran out of requested beverages food menus were not visible elevator is loud and sounds as if it is going to break at any time.;0;1;0;0;0;0
When the bar tender ran out of Bacardi rum she stated they only get stocked once a week - inventory issues?;0;1;0;0;0;0
After that we brought in our own alcohol.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Hotel stay was everything I expected.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beware of the front desk staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
If you reserve the room in advance they will charge you again and give you a attitude about a refund.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Won't stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Loved the location and the well-kept rooms.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Great spot!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect for what we wanted close to the beach and restaurants.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There is no elevatot and all the rooms are on the second floor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel was very nice and in the middle of a remodel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room we stayed in was new and we were happy with it.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It's right by the Newport Pier which is a very crowded area and there's an extremely busy parking lot right in front of the hotel.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I was happy with our stay but it was quite expensive so for that price I wouldn't want to go back to that location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Excellent location;0;0;1;0;0;0
We chose this place for the location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Walk out the front door to the beach.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Reastaurants bars and shops all around.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Christina at the front desk is super nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was niceclean but small with a comfy bed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The window was in the tub does not open.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast nothing special.;0;1;0;0;0;0

We only had one suitcase stand and had to use the only chair in the room for the second suitcase.;0;0;0;1;0;0
That meant I had to sit on the bed to put on my shoes.;0;0;0;0;0;0
high bed grout on bathroom floor was dirty along with a stained dividing curtain.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The bed was very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The lounge area was a good place to relax with big open air ocean views.;0;0;1;0;0;0
parking was limited I had to park on the street on the third night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect location and ambience for our romantic getaway.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Loved it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was in the area on business.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms are a bit small without desk or place to set up laptop....but that was easily worked out.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Absolutely will stay here every time I am in the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The restaurant  bar next door was amazing as well.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room was just liked it looked in the picture.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Hotel staff Madison was wonderfully helpful and made our stay feel like home.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Staying at a six sense hotel is always a good experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
However this hotel in particular was out this world.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The food is probably one the best food you will ever have.the spa is surreal.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The hotel staff is always smiling and willing to make your stay enjoyable.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The snorkeling is great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bay provides a wide range of dishes next to your cabanas and the beach.;0;1;1;1;1;0

You will not regret it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great hotel fabulous staff beautiful setting!;0;0;0;0;1;0

All staff helpful friendly and going the extra step to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing.;0;0;0;0;1;0
All villas in beautiful settings--either by the beach or 200 steps up--beautiful and everything you need is there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great service beautiful place.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The beach is not that great.;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had a fantastic stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Upon a delayed arrival 19 Sep the night clerk was outstanding.;0;0;0;0;0;0
From guiding 2 'lost' travellers to the hotel to assisting with booking a second night - he was the epltome of Irish hospitality.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The breakfasts were very filling and the wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Lovely hotel staff are so nice and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Very good food;0;1;0;0;0;0
If you happen to stay on a bank holiday request a room not overlooking the beautiful park.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The only fresh air comes from a space also overlooking the patio and bar.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The summer seeking guests can party very late.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Sleep was difficult.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We stayed here as the location was close to the motorway.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We were at the rental car return by Dublin Airport in just over an hour.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We also came from Glendalough and went to Greystones for dinner.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The hotel needs some refurbishing carpets saggy tiles cracked general maintenance but overall a very nice place.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Excellent value for money.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Staff very helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Good location and helpful staffs make our vacation more enjoyable.;0;0;1;0;1;0
It was at one time one of my favourite hotels in Vietnam  it is not that any more!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel has become old and delapatated .;0;0;0;0;0;0
To bad!;0;0;0;0;0;0
A woman at the lobby didn't get up to give me the key of the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
She was lying on a banc playing with her handphone.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No professional.;0;0;0;0;0;0
An average hotel with pleasant staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room was large and comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Lovely hotel with a fantastic breakfast and very helpful staff.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Would absolutely recommend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I had noisy neighbours above me constantly moving furniture.....how many times can you move a chair or a desk in a hotel room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very comfortable beds.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Amazing location within a 5 minutes walk to the beach and surrounded by shops and restaurants.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Dated with dirty bedspread and mouldy bathroom.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The breakfast room was sunny but up a flight of stairs.;0;1;0;1;0;0
The price was maybe a bit higher than other hotels around but they have a great breakfast included and they are right in the middle of the tourist area close to the beach bars and restaurants.;0;1;1;0;0;0
overall a good experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
cannot ask for more on the prices they are offering.;0;0;0;0;0;1
first room we got had some problems with ventilation but they changed it promptly.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice hotel good location;0;0;1;0;0;0
the room is OK and the breakfast is awful nothing to eat..;0;1;0;1;0;0
The hotel isn't complete so there is still construcion being conducted and construction supplies all over the hallways  Internet was spotty the entire time.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I couldn't stream a youtube video  No soap or shampoo in the bathroom after the first night  There was no cable in the room so you couldnt watch tv.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The tv had a netflix feature but the spotty internet did not allow you to connect;0;0;0;1;0;0
room has no outdoor window.;0;0;0;1;0;0
need better lighting inside the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice location average hotel breakfast not bad very good pool.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Our room was on the fourth floor so no road noise.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Loved this hotel staff very welcoming and friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Always surrounded by smiling people.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to all local attractions.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room smell of cigarettes smoke.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Location is convenient.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Wifi is available.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast choice not so good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Works in the hotel so wake too soon and cannot have a nap;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good hotel in a good location near the beach and night market.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was friendly and the breakfast was fine except it was only until 9 am.;0;1;0;0;1;0
There is just a lot of construction around this area and therefore it can be noisy.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Overall it was good value for a low rate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed here with 9 guests in 2 rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
They brought in extra beds and gave us a good discount on everything..;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was about 130 for 2 night for that many guests in our party.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The morning the offered a full breakfast buffet as part of the package.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Overall it was a good and clean hotel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Fair deal and accommodations for the price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would stay here again..;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only stayed the one night but very impressed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff comfy bedproper air con and rainfall shower.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Decent selection for the breakfast buffet aswell.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Only downside was the room was fairly small for 2 adults and their luggage;0;0;0;1;0;0
After an overnight train journey we arrived at 6.30 in the morning and the reception staff were kind enough to let us check in early.;0;0;1;0;1;0
The rooms were nice enough and the staff very friendly.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The hotel is in a great location and literally 5 mins from the beach.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would stay here again but only for a few nights.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I booked the room about four months in advance.;0;0;0;1;0;0
At the time it was me and one son.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The trip came and I took 2 sons.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Luckily they put another bed in my room and only charged me a little extra per night.;0;0;0;1;0;0
comfort and kind;0;0;0;0;0;0
I liked the hotel and its location close to the beach but it was noisy in the morning because of several constructions in the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
My room had a tab comfortable bed some English and one Russian channels on TV.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast was the same every day and had very simple choices for European breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Reception staff in the evenings had problems with English although the manager during the day was very helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice stay overall.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good location with a very good price.;0;0;1;0;0;0
In Nha Trang for the diving and beach scene.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Angella is centrally located just a block from the beach.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice staff clean facility and good breakfast buffet.;1;1;0;0;1;0
Good value for the money.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good location good price!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Lots of parking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Restaurants cafe etc are all 5 minutes walk away.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Comfortable bed.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Not well insulated...could hear other showers running and people talking outside the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Grounds requires more upkeep but love the area they are attempting to create with the picnic tables gazebo etc.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Will be nice when it's done.. Love that you can step outside and have access to your car.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was comfortable and affordable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff was great!! !;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room needed a good cleaning especially the bathroom.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The floor was filthy.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The mattress cover and pad did not fit the bed and the sheets looked  a little thread bare.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pillows had a musty smell.;1;0;0;0;0;0
It was a hot weekend and the AC ran all the time so that might have contributed to the musty smell.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Overall I'd say that the place needs a good overhaul.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I did stay there 4 years ago and it was in better shape;0;0;0;0;0;0
Chose not to stay here due To the fact that when we got there the area is very seedy.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The hotel is aged.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Myriad of spiders above the entrance doors at the evening spooky.;0;0;0;0;0;0
On positive side - everything in room is operational and location is convenient close to Marineland and the falls.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Adding one star because staff was kind to wait for us and checked in after hours.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great trip overnight stay clean quiet comfortable microwave fridge tv everything you need to enjoy the area.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Less than five minutes from the falls in the car.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Thanks for a great stay;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room is dark.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No available telephone in the room to call the hotel office or front desk.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The office/front desk is always close and no personnel to entertain the needs of the guest.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Never again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would not recxomend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Spiders in room stains on carpet holes in walls and doors.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Loud music and drunken party next door.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No front desk to call no phone in room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My kids called it the Spider Hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great place to stay close to everything by car and well priced..not the best hotel in all of Niagara but it will do the job as a safe hotel to stay in for you and your family.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The lodge definitely needs some outside remodeling but inside is a complete story.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bathroom looked brand new the beds were comfortable and overall everything was neat.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No outlets other than the ones in the bathroom and near the door such that the coffeemaker is placed in the bathroom which is weird.;0;0;1;1;0;0
The location is close to the Falls but not too dark at night.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nice BB with jacuzzi and gas fireplace.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was delicious.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Very comfortable beds and great staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Found this under my mattress after check in.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Found this bag of used needles under my mattress when I checked into my room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Management told me there was nothing they could do for me.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I had to call the cops to come and remove it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Think they would make sure my room was clean before I checked into it.;1;0;0;1;0;0
This is what I found under my matress.;0;0;1;1;1;0
Was told by staff that there was nothing they could do.;0;0;0;0;1;0
How about making sure my room is clean before I check in.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Ac leaked.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The room on the other hand was a different story the room was not clean upon check in.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Hair in the sheets hair in the bedding hair in the towels and inside the bathroom shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The floor was wet and sandy I guess beachgoers were staying before me.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The breakfast staff was outstanding!;0;1;0;0;1;0
Brian and Diana were so nice and stayed on top of breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
They had everything stocked and fresh for us and were so kind and even came to our table to ask we needed anything else!;0;0;0;0;0;0
They were great;0;0;0;0;0;0
