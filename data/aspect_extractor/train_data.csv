Close to everything....;0;0;0;0;0;0
This is an older hotel but delightful and very close to the 'Malecon' restaurants etc.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were in a small single bed room and they allowed us to have our small dog with us - a real plus!;0;0;0;1;0;0
We enjoyed our stay and will do it again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location  fair prices  nice staff.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Really cute place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Looks like the might be upgrading.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needs s bit of tlc.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed in this same area 14 years ago but couldnt find the bb so opted for the Lorimar.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We do not mind basic accomodations but knew we had made a mistake when we had to wind down a narrow dark hallway to find our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Dingy small run-down it was awful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were so happy the next day to find a nice bb nearby.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This place needs some major work to be decent.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Don't go here! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would not stay here again as many other alternative places are available.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was listed as a bit more upscale and a little pricier but really disappointed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Paint peeling off the walls only one bare light bulb all others missing No Toilet paper in the room and checked in late so did not want to try to get staff again.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Beds were wooded frames with thin mattress so not good either.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My friend and I were charged more than our reservation rate and they refused to give a refund for the difference.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Mattress was stained with ???;1;0;0;0;0;0
other mattress had Springs poking through and thread bare.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We slept on top of bedding as afraid of bugs mold on walls plaster falling off walls room tucked down a dark dirty hallway.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Had anything else been available for my one night stay I would have left.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The park bench felt like a better option.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel Lorimar is located in a great part of town with easy access to excellent beaches and walking distance to many restaurants and local shops.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The staff was very friendly accommodating and provided helpful information about the area.;0;0;1;0;1;0
4 days stay was OK nice neighborhood close to downtown are and one block from the harbor.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Clean everyday towels and friendly service.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Dogs barking at early hours and hot water in the shower take a while.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great location but the hotel is a little tired.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Dinner was excellent and the roads are great for biking.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Very nice and clean family run hotel Amazing surrounding  Nice and gig rooms  Really quite area;1;0;1;1;0;0
Quite a unique hotel standing alone next to the river in a beautiful setting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you can't relax there you won't relax anywhere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Some fittings are slightly dated but overall standard is quite high even more so for the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Wifi is OK but not excepetional mobile phone signal can disappear not necessarily a bad thing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely hotel on the outskirts of La-Roche-en-Ardennes.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was nice and comfortable but the bar and dining area were a bit stuffy for a casual weekend away.;0;1;1;0;0;0
It's great to stay surrounded by the nature;0;0;0;0;0;0
We only stayed one evening but the staff was very welcoming and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Gorgeous setting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's a quick 2km walk into La Roche on a lovely path but the staff were quick to point out it wasn't appropriate for our return back after a concert -- perfectly safe but no lights.;0;0;1;0;1;0
clean out the main area.;1;0;1;0;0;0
language for the staff breakfast needs to be improved;0;1;0;0;1;0
This hotel has a nice view of la spezia portbut is not convenient for those who drive to here because no parking is providedwe need to park at roadside outside this villa.;0;0;0;0;0;1
If you carry heave and big luaguage is also not recommend as there is no lift in this building;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean comfortable place with very handy location for visiting Cinque Terre and nice outlook over the bay.;1;0;1;0;0;0
We did not have a problem with the hotel except that it was too far from train station to walk and the taxi ride was too expensive-about 10 Euros.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The lady running this villa is very nice and helpful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A short drive to Porto Venere which is very nice as well as a short train ride to Cinque Terre.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The scenery is amazing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly helpful people.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Amazing plantings.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was spotless.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Nothing special.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was clean but old.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Fine for the price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I'm sure it is wonderful in the summer  great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We are lifelong visitors with family in the area but needed more beds for the weekend.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I did a review of the local hotels and took a chance the pics were accurate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was very happy with the cleanliness and neatness of the hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Very clean friendly staff.;1;0;0;0;1;0
A nice small place to stay;0;1;1;1;1;0
Great location with friendly staff that feels like coming home at night rather than a cookie cutter motel.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Rooms are very clean modern and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The flower gardens surrounding the property are a unique experience you’ll find no where else.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It’s our only choice from now on.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We brought our 12 year old granddaughter and her friend as a birthday gift to her.;0;0;0;0;0;0

We also went mini golfing at Pirate's Cove and spent some time at Funspot arcade.;0;0;0;0;0;1
There is a lot to do in area for children and adults.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Meredith is just up the road and a beautiful place to visit.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay at the Summit.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was more rustic than I had thought but clean and surprisingly spacious.;1;0;0;1;0;0
We were in NH for a wedding and requested an early check-in if possible.;0;0;0;0;0;0
When we arrived they said that they were ready for us and were able to go right into our room which we really appreciated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The grounds and the pool were beautiful and very close to Weirs Beach and great shopping.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Spent the day boating on Lake Winnipesaukee.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Great time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The place was clean but very out dated.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Kids loved the pools and amenities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
What a beautiful room we walked into after meeting such a friendly receptionist that checked us in quickly!;0;0;1;1;1;0
The grounds are beautiful and quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The multiple pools were a huge hit for my family!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will be returning!;0;0;0;0;0;0
the beds were very hard which meant sleepless nights              some of the blankets were still covered in hair so I don't think they were washed;0;0;0;0;0;1
This was a great location near the Bank of NH Pavilion.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The room was extremely spacious and well appointed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The pool area was above average and had beautiful views.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I’d definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
great location to stay as we were seeing a concert at the Bank of NH Pavilion just 3 miles away;0;0;1;0;0;0
Got there check-in was 4pm got there at 430 went to room and the cleaners were still in it said come back in 20 min.;0;0;0;1;0;0

Over all nice place and friendly desk.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice clean indoor pool.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Room was nice only bad thing beds were super hard like a rock but would stay again;0;0;0;1;0;0
Would definitely come back and stay here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Taxi services were very limited while concerts going on at Bank Pavillion;0;0;0;0;1;0
Terrible place.....wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Expect the room that was in an OK condition everything else outside of it  because of the reconstruction of the building was nothing compared to a normal facility !;0;0;0;1;0;0
Hotel room was DIRTY.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Bed was very uncomfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No AC in the lobby.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kayak was stolen out of the back of my truck in the parking lot and the front desk was less than helpful or empathetic.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Refused to call police and file a report.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will NEVER stay there again and don't recommend anyone ever stay there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is under EXTENSIVE construction.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hopefully that will fix the situation.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you don't want to stay in a building currently undergoing extreme renovations make sure the construction is complete before making your reservation.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We arrived at the hotel and thought it was closed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is totally under construction windows out scaffolding etc..;0;0;0;1;0;0
This was not mentioned when the reservation was made however it was quiet and clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Not the most comfortable bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was under construction no pardon our appearance signs or anything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Windows were out of the building.. it was terrible.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I would like to discuss some sort of refund;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was OK.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The Hotel is in a radical renovation process with construction work even in the loby.;0;0;0;0;0;0
So many things must be excused but the breakfast was lousy.;0;1;0;0;0;0
There were toasters but no bread to be toasted no egs in any form raisin bran partly powdered.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Very strict hotel... beds were not comfortable couldn’t even look out the window because the outside of it was covered in blue paint.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I don’t feel like this hotel was worth 140 a night not by a long shot.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Dated run-down.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms in poor condition sparsely furnished with old worn furniture.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Some healthy options at breakfast but nothing warm - much less hot.;0;1;0;0;0;0
At one time the Landmark was a good hotel BUT it has fallen way behind.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Needs updating and better maintenance.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Ice machines do not work and are located on every other floor.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Housekeeping replaced the towels but not the soaps.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I know big item.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was just ok nothing to rave about.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Oh I haven't seen a CATHODE RAY TUBE TV IN QUITE A WHILE.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good location staff was nice.;0;0;1;0;1;0
That's it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room smelled like smoke though the hotel is currently no smoking it had to have been at one time.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It's just a mess on many floors due to construction.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bed was ok not the worst.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would not stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was run down no fridge in room no vending machines!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast was way too early... ;0;1;0;0;0;0
Undergoing much needed renovations.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lots of 'rules' that didnt exist the last time we stayed here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Have to eat food in lobby.;0;1;0;0;0;0
No visitors.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Damage deposit hold on credit card.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Not what I was expecting - the bed was really uncomfortable and the elevators were several months past inspection.;0;0;0;0;0;1
They were able to accommodate us with an early check in though;0;0;0;0;0;1
Options for other hotels were limited so to avoid having to drive home after a concert at Meadowbrook I booked one night/2 double beds.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Both the beds and the pillows they provided were extremely uncomfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No updates have been made to this location for at least 10-15 years.....very outdated peeling wallpaper in the bathroom.;0;0;1;1;0;0
If you stay here be sure to bring your own pillows and towels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is decent not sparkling clean but ok!;1;0;0;0;0;0
Have stayed in worse.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel is very dingy needs upgrading but the room was not bad better than I expected after reading some other reviews.;0;0;0;1;0;0
For one night it’s fine.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is close to the bank of NH concerts about 3.5 miles.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room wasn't ready for early check in.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Then someone entered room after I had checked in because they didn't notify staff the room had been cleaned.;1;0;0;1;1;0
Very unsettling.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Walls very thin could hear conversations in next room word for word.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No coffee in room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
No frig microwave or iron.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room OK.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Whole hotel needs updating;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was in town for the Nascar Race and found it to be a short ride to the stadium.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was great with the room and hotel.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Had a great stay and will revisit.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0

But other than that room view was amazing;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice hotel noisy neighbors  They kept us awake after 3am;0;0;0;0;0;1
Bad thing is no microwave.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Even the 2 stars motel has one.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was a lovely location with a nice sandy beach front lush green grounds and near to great eateries.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good breakfast room all included is a plus.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sadly the maintenance needs a face lift.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Carpeting bathroom counters and room decor need upgrade.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The pool was lovely and well maintained.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice to find indoor fascilities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I think it will be lovely here even this winter.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The area we stayed in was good - The Inn.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The main building had a creepy floor that reminded us of the Shining with dated hallways and dim lighting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were trying to find the game room but it was being renovated so it was closed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The pool  sauna and hot tub were great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was good- big selection.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room was big but the beds were uncomfortable wasn’t a pullout couch so had to pay for a cot which no one informed me prior to coming and the room was booked for 5 people.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The place was very nice but a little bit pricey!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Off season not a lot to do!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Front desk staff was fantastic and very helpful!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Pool was great!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Could use a full time restaurant and a tea and coffee bar all day!;0;1;0;0;0;0
Wasn’t convenient my room was a cross of street from the pool and the gym for the price I was expecting more.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The beach is lovely here the pool and hot tub are great.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The continental breakfast was nice.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Aside from being evacuated from the building at 6AM due to a faulty smoke detector or some other sort of false alarm it was a nice stay.;0;1;1;1;1;0
The room was very nice and roomy.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The beds were super comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The pool lobby/bar and hot tub were awesome.;0;1;0;0;0;0

Great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The first room was not ready so we were given a up grade closer to the water.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The King size bed was very squeaky and lumpy.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to beach...nice place..bar on water...beautiful view...bed a little hard..;0;1;0;0;0;0

Room was nice and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Beds comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Easy access plenty of parking nice pool nice Beach Bar had a great time.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Have stayed here before and will again.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Stained sheets staff didnt care;1;0;0;0;1;0
Nice location!!!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Easy and Convenient!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Comfortable!;0;0;0;0;0;0
older cottages but they are clean and reasonably priced.;1;0;0;0;0;0
the owner is very nice and accommodating;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was exactly what we thought it would be like...a night of camping just not in a tent.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very enjoyable!;0;0;0;0;0;0
very happy with communication and special need to park boat trailer with access to plug in battery charger.;0;0;1;1;1;0
We had unexpected delay in showing upa and they were very helpful getting us set up and checked in.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Cottage was clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
No heat and it was a cold weekend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Coffee pot had old coffee and mold in the coffee basket.;1;1;0;0;0;0
No one came in after first night to see message about coffee pot so we were unable to have coffee at all.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Very noisy location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would never go in the summer during busy season.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wifi was unavailable!!!!!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lousy connection;0;0;0;0;0;0
I enjoyed the service of the staff as well as the room itself.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Excellent!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Could'n't be happier.;0;0;0;0;0;0
great stay!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect for a one night stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were in for the Highland Games  Festival in September.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I am familiar with Laconia and always wanted to stay close to the Weird Beach  Boardwalk.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very cute 50’s feel cottage beds were a bit uncomfortable but for one night it was ok.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Talked to person thru microphone told us key under mat.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room smelled musty;1;0;0;1;0;0
The room is much bigger and nicer than I expected it to be.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Check in was a breeze.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My only complaint is that there is what looks like dog fur on both pillow cases and that makes me wonder if they were even changed/cleaned between guests.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Otherwise the room appears very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
There were bugs in our room and staff were rude and not helpful;0;0;0;1;1;0
The floor of the cottage was not level.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Futon in the living room was way too low to sit and get up.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff was rude not helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
we found a cockroach in our room and I brought it to the manager Heather and she confirmed it was a roach and said we must have brought it to the hotel or it came from outside.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Told me we were a pain in the ass.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would not recommend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Saw a review that there was roaches should had listened.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location is excellent which is what you're really paying for.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The staff were extremely friendly and check in and out was a breeze.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Our cottage smelled terrible - like old cigarette smoke and a mix of mold/mildew.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The bathroom is small and the place is run down.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I thought the bed was comfortable my husband disagreed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It wasn't the nicest place but I would stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I loved the screened in porch.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beds were very lumpy and hard room is aged and needs updating.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Way overpriced for the conditions;0;0;0;0;0;0
My excellent adventure took me out onto the lake for hours leaving little time for anything else.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This property was exactly what we were looking for.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Located close to everything open that time of year the price was competitive.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Monica the manager is amazing.;0;0;0;0;1;0
we required help unloading and loading all of our suitcases etc.;0;0;0;0;0;0
the staff was a wonderful smilling help assisting us.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They could not dom enough to help us.;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had to cancel and kind of medical and the hotel would give me back my money until they realize I’ve booked thru to you and they could not I was never informed of that;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel worked for us but it had a 'worn' feel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There were 'pardon our dust' signs all over but saw no evidence of any renewals.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our room had water damage on the ceiling.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I was not able to get the wheelchair under the ADA room sink in the bathroom or see in the mirror.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The sheets were never changed I know because there was lipstick or some kind of makeup on the sheets the whole time we were there;0;0;0;0;0;0
We selected this hotel because of it's proximity to The Villages and the low cost.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It's a nice basic hotel and was typical of any Hampton Inn you would see almost anywhere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Over the course of eight days we stayed at five different hotels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Hampton Inn provided the best comfort for the best price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The didn't have extra fees for the roll away bed the breakfast was delicious and the room was very modern and clean.;1;1;0;1;0;0
Everything was nice except no one serviced the room... no trash removal no clean towels nothing.;1;0;0;1;1;0
From arrival to departure we only saw smiles on the faces of two members of staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
That summed up our stay here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is a series of boxes with beds put together to make money.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No one on the staff seemed to have a desire to offer hospitality.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Would avoid this hotel and this brand in the future.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was the most relaxing stay..Quiet and comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Staff very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice village surrounding with several stores and restaurants to choose from....I'd differently come back again...;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hampton Inns provide great value for the money spent.;0;0;0;0;0;1
This particular Hampton Inn was no exception.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was one of the cleanest i've ever stayed in.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was also exceptionally friendly and welcoming.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I would definitely stay here again when visiting family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was a very nice hotel with attentive staff and good access to the area.;0;0;1;0;1;0

The cake and warm cookies in the common area were truly a bonus.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Absolutely perfect Highly recommend;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great boutique hotel in the heart of Lafayette.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Service is top notch.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Fresh cookies and bananas available at all times.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room is spacious.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bath tub is very large.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only negatives: a/c was quite noisy in our room and pillows were small and uncomfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Overall a very nice experience for myself and my wife.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was great!;0;0;0;0;0;0
exceeded my expectations.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The free breakfast didn't have any choices that appealed to me because I don't like croissants.;0;1;0;0;0;0
But it was FREE breakfast so no complaints from me.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I didn't ask if there were alternatives -- they might have been able to accommodate me if I asked.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was super clean smelled good and the staff was very welcoming and friendly!;1;0;0;0;1;0
Would definitely recommend staying here;0;0;0;0;0;0
The property is immaculate the staff are wonderful it’s in a great location.;0;0;1;0;1;0
This boutique hotel has everything you could want and the staff can’t be more helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
A for everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Even to the cake and coffee left out for self help during the day.;0;1;0;0;0;0
This hotel is a gem in downtown Lafayette.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Impeccably clean large rooms everything nice new and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Will definitely be coming back.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Always a nice place to stay in a great area not the same old cookie cutter franchise hotel.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This property  horrid.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed 7 days  6 of them a beer bottle full of urine sat in the breezeway.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Staff refused to have it cleaned up despite many calls to front desk.;1;0;0;0;1;0
Pictures are quite deceptive.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They ended up charging me 54.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Ucks when they said 45 and i. Didnt care ckr that;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was horrible and wanted a refund but couldn't get one the rooms were a mess had junk and trash and smelled terrible I'll never ever stay there again they let that place to down hill;1;0;0;1;0;0
Well I reserved a room for last Saturday and I checked out Monday the TV only have one channel there was no microwave the refrigerator was barely cold and there was a bar sticking out from under the bed and the carpet look like they just patched it together I wouldn't recommend anyone staying at this hotel;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very clean nice thoughtful and generous staff anytime maintenance and friendly owners;1;0;0;0;1;0

Roaches in bathroom when I turned the light on.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pulled back sheets in bed and roach ran off of pillow under mattress.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lifted corner of mattress and found nest of at least a dozen roaches under corner of mattress.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They initially refused today give me a refund until I had the clerk call them owner am tell them I have a video of them roaches that's I will send today there state dept.;0;0;0;0;0;0
of health.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good cant complain for the price but would recommend to remodel the rooms;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was a cool place to relax but for business I'll probably stick to hotels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The clawfoot tub was beautiful and probably relaxing but rough for someone accustomed to a quick morning shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I have stayed at Bogobiri before and so was disappointed at how run down the place has become.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A lick of paint and re-organisation of the furniture new bedding etc would make such a difference.;0;0;0;0;0;1
There were prolonged power outages during my stay and breakfast was sparse no butter or jam for my toast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
It is a shame as this is a unique place which can have a lovely atmosphere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautifully decorated rooms...great food courteous staff.;0;1;0;1;1;0
Within walking distance to local eateries as well.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Bogobiri is a comfortable guesthouse with artistic decoration in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
If you are looking for a private place like home this could be your option.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But definitely not for people who are looking for a nice hotel room and service experience.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The staff are very helpful and provide prompt service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
What I did not like is the full charge for having breakfast in the room when my booking included complimentary breakfast.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Need more food for expats mainly Nigerian food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Service quality must improve;0;0;0;0;1;0
Awesome location awesome staff rooms r Roomy would return over and over nxt time I will try the executive room;0;0;1;1;1;0
Breakfast was a let down limited choice and some of the food was dry.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The rooms are ok but bathrooms could do with a renovation.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My room Was overlooking a rubbish dump which was not a pleasant sight.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Got a room which didn’t have a working AC or bathtub.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Had to move rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Housekeeping staff were slow to requests.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Great location with happy staffs;0;0;1;0;1;0
Best experience so far in a lagos hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing breakfast as well.;0;1;0;0;0;0
My only problem is their bath tub is too high and was very uncomfortable getting into it as a new mom.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was good but ate dinner twice in the hotel and the food was not particularly nice.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Expensive for the quality.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The pool was dirty and not cleaned while I was there.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The sink leaked but was not fixed and to delete any phone messages you need to call IT who came and deleted them??? .;0;0;1;1;1;0
The staff were friendly and polite and the room cleaner was excellent.;1;0;0;1;1;0
The rooms are large.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel seems to be old and need an uplift.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The cleanliness was not to my expectations.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Awesome service;0;0;0;0;1;0
I was really impressed with this hotel similar hotels in NYC usually cost double the price.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The front desk staff porter and security guards were top notch.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This will definitely be my new hotel in Lagos no doubt!! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
I never could get an hotel like this in that area of Lagos.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Everything about the hotel was fantabulous including the staff right from the gate man/woman security.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I will visit the hotel anytime I am in Nigeria.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good management.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The Staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast was good with both local and international options.;0;1;0;0;1;0
it was clean and nicely laid out.;1;0;0;0;0;0
We were on a quick business trip so we didn't get to try out all the facilities but I would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to Lagos.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This was one of the better hotel in Lagos as far as cleanlines and friendlyness of staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We enjoyed the hotel so much that we stayed at the hotel twice in one trip simple because it made our stay comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was friendly greeted with warm welcome.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Smart TV in room was a plus however could not seem to get the free movies that was offered.;0;0;0;1;0;0
ATM also in hotel for convenience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel not located near activities you can walk to however a car hire is available also for convenience.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Solid choice of hotel in this area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Extremely pleasant stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A bit out of town but only a short walk.;0;0;1;0;0;0
But more than made up for with a short walk to a cute beach to watch the sunset.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Never judge a book by its cover is so apt here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
What an awesome place with high level of furniture and amenities within the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0

Laguna Beach is a charming place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is sort of a let down but offers free convenient parking and relatively reliable wifi and a modest price point.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Great location staff was very nice a quick walk to the beach great shower!;0;0;1;1;1;0
We spent most of our time at a wedding.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It was nice to arrive to a room was fresh and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Older motel from the 50's free breakfast was a misrepresentation - cheap roll in celophane standing coffee pot in a very small lobby.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The room itself however was nice.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Located north of Laguna center by about 1.5 miles.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Parking was a heart stopper due to narrow stalls with vertical steel poles.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Arrived 9 pm walked into the most dirty floors room 1” gap underneath door no bugs or critters yet.;1;0;1;1;0;0
Bad spaces in boards no beach leakage in parking garages.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I could go on but Hotels.com did us right by correcting a very unpleasant situation!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice and comfortable hotel with a 3 minute walk to the beach.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was very nice and the rooms are well kept.;0;0;0;1;1;0

Our party of four spent 18 nights in Unit B-401.;0;0;0;0;0;1

Close enough to the beach for walking but far enough away to be quiet.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Surprise of having private parking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
While it being a pleasant hotel with lovely staff  my stay was overshadowed by being in a room directly over the entrance.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Room 11.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I heard everybody arriving and leaving and it was like Chinese water torture as I had to be up at 4:30 am to catch a flight.;0;0;0;0;0;0
People knocking loudly on the entrance every so often after midnight meant I didn’t sleep at all.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I did eat in the restaurant and the food was tasty and filling.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Disappointed with the Hotel needs updating parking very limited.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Thought it was great place just a fun reminder no elevator.;0;0;0;0;0;1
So don’t bring heavy luggage.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice stay central to most attractions in clare food was good little bit on the dear side for starters but mains were reasonably priced.;0;1;1;0;0;0
we often go to lahinch.staff at this hotel very friendly and best breakfast even compared with supposedly better hotels;0;1;0;0;1;0

That was cheap done on purpose.;0;0;0;0;0;1
A nice hotel no frills but not the best value for money;0;0;0;0;0;1
Room was clean and bed was comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Advertised amenities were not open such as cabana bar.;0;1;0;0;0;0

However it seems they are slowly renovating which that completed looks very good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Some areas outside in badly need to painting - so much so some wood will need replacing.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Some staff seemed tired from busy summer months maybe could have been a bit more outgoing but still professional.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I'd definitely stay at Geneva Inn again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Amazing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great views and an clean place so stay.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Suite with balcony and lake view exactly as described.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was a beautiful view.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The suite was big and exactly what we wanted for our weekend away.;0;0;1;1;1;0
We enjoyed our stay at the Geneva Inn.;0;0;0;0;0;0
All the special touches made us feel very special turn down each evening with chocolates and liqueur and coffee bar in the hallway in the morning.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Staff was super nice!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Check in was rocky;0;0;0;0;0;1
Very nice place to stay no pool great location on lake;0;0;1;0;0;0
This was a nice quite place to recharge.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was excellent food great and nice view.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Good location to walk around.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Was a very big comfortable Jing bed and room had a balcony.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It would have been better with the lakeside view but was nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very big bathroom and was excited to see a whirlpool tub as well as a large shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The whirlpool jets were perfect.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We ate dinner at the hotel for our anniversary.;0;1;0;0;0;0
It was a  little expensive at but it was really good food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Beautiful watching the sunset ask for a window seat at the restaurant.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Didn't have paper towels or napkins in kitchen area also staff not very personal only one person at desk spoke when coming in and out;0;0;1;1;1;0
Right on the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful view in the restaurant but I wouldn't recommend eating there unless you like your breakfast cold when it should be delivered hot.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Ok. We just wanted a good night's rest.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Did not like the check in.;0;0;0;0;0;1
You had to call a phone number for someone to come and open the office.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I did not have a phone to call with.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Waited 15 minutes when someone lent us a phone to call.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bed was uncomfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Bad wifi.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Awesome location .;0;0;1;0;0;0
staff friendly courteous and professional   Excellent experience we decided to return again.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This is our second stay here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Old gross rooms smell floors slant.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Don't stay here I couln't sleep afraid of bed bugs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Just awful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
First there was not enough parking so I had to park way away from the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I stayed in a first floor room and it sounded like there was just a sheet between us and the upstairs room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The banging from walking went on all morning.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Zero hot water for the shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bed was OK room was clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
If you are looking for a place to just crash after a night of going out partying then compared to the other motels it was worth the money.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This place is old school right out of the 60's which I can appreciate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
These are the little motels we used to stay at as kids growing up.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nothing fancy just a place to rest your head after a full day of taking in the Lake George area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
If you are expecting luxury you will be disappointed but for the price it works.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Poor staff that never pick up the phone.;0;0;0;0;1;0
People in the parking lot doing beer bongs and driving around at 10 AM.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Looks like a bed bug and mildew paradise.;0;0;0;0;0;0
After seeing the place I was not surprised to see used condoms in the parking lot and of course through all of this NO REFUND!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Well-located friendly staff and very clean.;1;0;0;0;1;0
My only negative point is that the Wifi was spotty.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We'd definitely book there again ;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good location !;0;0;1;0;0;0
Close to food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room was overall clean but Needs updating.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The beds arent the most confortable around.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very nice staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Only thing the wifi Didnt work which really sucked.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great customer service Lizette was absolutely wonderful!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Just needed 1 night most places in Lake George have a min 2 night stay...This place offers 1 night stay or more...;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stay here every year.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's clean quiet simple and comfortable.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nothing fancy.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The pool is clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Each room has a safe and little refrigerator.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It's close enough that you can walk comfortably into Lake George village yet far enough away that it's quiet.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Win-win.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pleasant stay perfect location - close to Lake and Downtown;0;0;1;0;0;0
This is the kind of motel where you don't dare to take your shoes off.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was dated tiny and in rough shape.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Despite that the worst part was the parking we drove a truck there and it was ridiculously difficult to get in the parking lot and back out without other people moving.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We left a day early just so we wouldn't have to spend an extra night...;0;0;0;0;0;0
Which we paid for in advance.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It has a great location and its clean and easily accessible to the lake.;1;0;1;0;0;0
the staff is friendly and accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It has a pool although it was closed at this time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Alot of families come here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms are in good condition and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Its rate is way cheap than all others.;0;0;0;0;0;0
and i would stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
we were lucky to have found a motel room available at time of our visit.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Thanks to ORBITZ for helping us find a vacancy at Hotel Montreal.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would go back again but would request a room without a room above it.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great motel for a weekend trip away from the hustle of the strip but still close to walk.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This place is right out of the 50's.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Creeky floor and you can hear every movement in adjoining rooms and above as well.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bed was old and soft wrinkled carpet very small room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Motel is close by but there are tons of other hotels/motels that are around and better.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Marine village is in a fantastic location right in the middle of the village of Lake George.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Awesome lakefront beach beautiful view;0;0;0;0;0;0
Did not get the Lakeside room that I reserved.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Walls are paper thin.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Noisy refrigerator.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bathtub pitted.;0;0;0;0;0;0
great downtown location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
very clean hotel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
We'll definitely stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect location right on the lake and downtown Lake George.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We like the closeness of this motel to the lake george village area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The room we had had a funny smell to it like it was musty or old.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Other than that the room was fine and quiet.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was amazing!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location and property is absolutely perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We can't wait to make reservations for next year.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Low pressure  low key  beautiful location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We arrived just after the summer session ended  so the restaurant whose menu was in the room appeared closed for the season.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Hotel checkin staff took pains to ensure the prices would be easy.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They called to confirm our checkin time the day before.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We are pleased we chose Marine Village.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very relaxing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was friendly  helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Proximity to water was an added plus.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Could use some updating but overall clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Very clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
2 King beds in one room;0;0;0;1;0;0

walk to all see lake from everywhere just perfect;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nice hotel on a little beach and close to other restaurants and stores in town.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Where there are other activities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lake George is a very pretty area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Chair in the room would be a nice addition.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Beds were very uncomfortable but the room was very nice other than that.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We are happy with our stay in your resort.;0;0;0;0;0;0
You still allowed us to park even thought we already check out this is a Plus service in your resort.;0;0;0;0;1;0
You gave us more time to explore the whole area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms were not cleaned and the baathroom need an upgrade for sure.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The only positive thing was that it was next to water front and nothing else.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would not recommend to stay in this property;0;0;0;0;0;0
Marine village is walking distance to town which is perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It has a private beach and cheap boat rentals which is great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms are run down and musty but it's still pricey because of great location.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Overall I  would go back bc of location to beach and town.;0;0;1;0;0;0
very nice quiet and clean and conviniet to all shops and rest.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Nice hotel shops and restaurants within walking distance.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Loved every aspect of this place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
First time at lake george and i was not disappointed with the suncastle villas/condos.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There were a lot of flies in the bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was a hair brush entangled with someone's hair.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Eating ice cream was in the refrigerator.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Room was quite musty.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Towels were visibly stained.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Wifi did not work at all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was no where to be found.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Did not attend the front desk and did not answer phones.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The beds were not comfortable.. the t.v.;0;0;0;0;0;1
was tiny... but it was at least clean;1;0;0;0;0;0
Lovely hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Owners were friendly and accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Clean and spacious suite with separate room for kids and kitchenette.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The kids loved the indoor pool.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will definitely return.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The first room they gave us was dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The room they switched us to had garbage on the deck.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We had to ask for towels toilet paper tissues and an ice bucket.The tv/cable service was terrible.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Had to keep turning it off and on every time we changed the channel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed there last year it was much better!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Won’t stst there again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room had holes in the wall stuffed with toilet paper.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There were numerous flies.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The toilet was running and had a dirty bath towel hanging in the door.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Room had a foul smell.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It was totally misrepresented as a suite for the room outside the bedroom was 8x 6 feet.;0;0;0;1;0;0
They have a really nice playground for the kids but it could use some lawn care.;0;0;0;0;0;1
They have indoor and outdoor pool and hot tub with decent hours.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Its walking distance to Magic Forest!;0;0;1;0;0;0
The room was very very small!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very uncomfortable!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The pool area was pleasant.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I would not stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pictures are very deceiving!!;0;0;0;0;0;0

There was a tiny charcoal grill.;0;0;0;0;0;0
10 rooms had to share 1 picnic table.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Exercise room picture showed different equipment.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My kids lost their money in the rundown video machines.;0;0;0;0;0;0

No one at the desk when we arrived.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Had to wait 45 minutes.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The children’s play area is overgrown with weeds and neglected.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room was on the small size but big enough for 2 people.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was a musty smell in the room and we saw a couple of bugs.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The bathroom was small and the sink didn't have a vanity to place your toiletries on so getting ready was difficult.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Our TV didn't work so they brought us a replacement but that had issues as well volume and changing the channels.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The exterior of the resort looks awesome so we were somewhat disappointed with the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very nice place to stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was happy with heated pool.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Very quiet..did not hear the traffic from I87 which runs behind hotel..didn't even hear guests in other room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Will be staying there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I booked this hotel because it had an indoor pool but they said it was closed for the season!!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Had a very disappointed child!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was very noisy people slamming doors banging.;0;0;0;0;0;1

Bathrooms are very small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Cracked vinyl in shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0

Looks good in photos but will not say again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room and bath were small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice outdoor pool area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Price was reasonable for the lake George area at the time of year.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Our stay was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff clean room.;1;0;0;1;1;0
The only issue was the pool being ice cold but the staff did tell me ahead of time;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room was very neat and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Bathroom was extremely small with a leaking faucet in bathtub.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Front desk people were very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Quaint motel in a great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Close to everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were there on the last night of the season and gpt upgraded to a king room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Desk staff were great.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Room was clean and typical of what is expected from an older motel.;1;0;0;1;0;0
I would suggest to make reservations on a weekend to eat   Town of Lake George was packed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very clean hotel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
and the staff was excellent.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It was close to the lakecand shopping area.;0;0;1;0;0;0

The front office was so accommodating for both a late check-in and check-in.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We were given the type room reserved and it was clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
My only complete is the pillows.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It seems all hotels are going to fat pillows that stand up for a trendy look when making the bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But the fat lumpy pillows are not comfortable for sleeping.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Don't get me wrong I like trendy but not at the expense of a good night's sleep.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean rooms.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Nice bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very friendly  staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The view was AMAZING and in room was in walking distance to the strip but the bathroom was just a little too small.;0;0;1;1;0;0
When you took a shower the shower curtain kept touching you but everything else was great;0;0;0;1;0;0
Small room with a ridiculously small bathroom and a very soft mattress.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice and clean heated outdoor pool.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Wi-Fi was very good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Check in was easy.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The room was clean and comfy.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Pool was clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Grounds were nice and I liked the assigned parking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to everything but pushed back enough off the main road to give you some quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No complaints at all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was very nice!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was super clean and the person checking us in was really pleasant and efficient.;1;0;0;0;0;0
A few rowdy folks staying but they were firmly asked to quiet down by the staff without us having to say anything.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Perfect location for activities downtown.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff was great.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Very friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice clean and maintained 'Mom and Pop' run hotel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Would come back again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location to town.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We like the staff and motel.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The pool is great;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very clean and a great place to stay while visiting lake George.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent service!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great location!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Staff very friendly walking distance into village clean rooms;1;0;1;1;1;0
The room was nice high ceilings and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Staff were friendly and it's a great location to be so you can walk around the village rather than drive everywhere.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Bathroom was tiny but room was clean and bed was comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Air conditioner worked fine.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice motel clean  comfortable and convenient to walking downtown.;1;0;1;0;0;0
Very nice people working there as well .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I thought the room was exceptionally clean!;1;0;0;1;0;0
Big kudos for that!- the bed awesome and comfy.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My only suggestion vs a complaint would be to update the other furniture!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very outdated and tired.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bathroom was nicely done but skimped in amenities.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I think they are working on things I realize it takes time... would definitely stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Thank you;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Admiral Motel is very clean and comfortable with easy walking access to pretty much anything in the central village of Lake George.;1;0;1;0;0;0
The mattress on the bed was amazing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would definitely stay here again in the future.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very peaceful inviroment clean updated room.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Or second time here and will be back again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stay was good unfortunately the walls are soo paper thin we could hear every word the neighbors were saying.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Would stay again would just opt to stay in the duplex’s not the rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The facility was clean and safe the management was friendly and we felt comfortable during our stay.;1;0;0;0;1;0
The internet was very spotty and we had problems with the small coffee maker but otherwise our stay went well.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Internet was very spotty and the hot tub was broke .;0;0;0;0;0;1
Owners were very personable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very relaxing 4 fun filled days.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I plan to return in a couple months;0;0;0;0;0;0
The owners are very nice!;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's a nice private resort.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very convenient location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
8 minutes dive to Lake George Village.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel Management was very friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
If you plan on barbecuing leave your grill at home there are gas grills on site.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The place is completlu run down and has old carpets that smell awful.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The pool water is freezing and the pool deck/are is so old and lacks care that some one could get hurt.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Terrible place that should not be cold a resort.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very nice property for the family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to town and activities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Family owned and operated and they are very accommodating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good value for the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The establishment is dog friendly so it was the biggest plus for us.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room was clean just missing a chair or table to sit by or place things on while in the room.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Close distance to the center.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quiet at night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I loved it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I like that it's cute and cozy and all the nature beauty around it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
If I would like to add something it would be maybe selling snacks and selling maybe bread or  donuts for the morning.;0;1;1;1;1;0
Trudy and Chris were amazing!;0;0;0;0;0;0
From the moment we checked in.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Great place;0;0;0;0;0;0
Excellent.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We have traveled numerous times but never felt as welcomed as we did at Lee’s everything was amazing the STAFF is exceptional makes you feel like you visiting family.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We are definitely going back next summer.;0;0;0;0;0;0
HIGHLY RECOMMEND;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Interstate traffic made it impossible to keep windows open.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Bathroom very small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I had an amazing stay at Lee’s motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I’ll be back with my whole family to experience Lake George and stay at Lee’s.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The owner made my husband and I feel at home.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The cabin was super clean and fit our needs for my Birthday’s gateaway.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I even had a happy birthday banner outside my cabin door.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I recommend Lee’s for people that wants to experience a cabin feel and like me that I’m overwhelm with big fancy hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Booked this for a weekend at the last minute during peak season so it was a bit pricey for the type of room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The place was last decorated along time ago but kept clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The location is in between the factory outlets and Lake George village.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Not close enough to walk to either  but that’s a good thing if you like quiet.;0;0;1;0;0;0
We stayed here August 04 to Aug 8.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed in one of the cabins.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
and had a kitchenette.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A/C worked great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff very friendly and came over to greet us and welcome us.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We really like that =   We are planning to stay here on our future trips to Lake George =;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice small cabins.;0;0;1;1;1;0
BBQ and frig if you want to cook.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quiet and comfy setting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Mom and pop shop.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very outdated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice staff   Sheets always felt damp.;0;0;0;0;1;0
My son and I stayed at Lee’s for a whitewater rafting trip.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The owner Chris was unbelievably welcoming and helpful giving us great local insights.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was clean WiFi and TV were great and the A/C worked fine though a bit old.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Would absolutely stay here again - a great value!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good;0;0;0;0;0;0
Convenient and located in the center of all activities;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was my first vacation and I decided to go to Lake George.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed at Lee's motel and I liked it very much.;0;0;0;0;0;0
From my first sight.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's a pretty good quiet place especially for those who has little kids.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Thanks owner and his family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had a good time there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I recommend it to all;0;0;0;0;0;0
Always a beautiful place by the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Next time I would book a room with a lake view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room was nice though.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We really like the view from our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Also it was an easy walk to the village.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room was very large and clean;1;0;0;1;0;0
Nice hotel in the center of Lake George a short walk to the downtown shops;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nicely maintained hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean with good amenities.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Awful dirty room holes in walls bugs - TERRIBLE;1;0;0;1;0;0
Seems like they just renovated some of the rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The stay was good but walls are too thin.;0;0;0;0;0;0
You can hear lots of noise from the hallway and rooms next to yours.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel is in a good spot.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Has direct access to the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pool and bar also has nice visibility to the lake.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Village main area is about a 5-10 min walk.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Overall I would recommend staing here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was on the water but not a lot of room for swimming in the lake.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Had a nice pool.;0;0;0;0;0;0
And roof bar was nice.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The hotel is old and needs updates.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms also had dust throughout and a dirty toilet.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Stairs are rotting and dangerous.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was a short walk to Village and on the lake which was good.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Had an amazing time with a family of 6.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was excellent.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The pool and lake were great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The view from the lake view rooms are amazing.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Just wish there was more space to sit on the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Other than that no complaints.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Comfy beds.;0;0;0;0;0;1
I just wish they upgraded my room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Everything else great .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Will go back but will get lake view room;0;0;0;1;0;0
Need to provide coffee the beds were hard.;0;1;0;0;0;0
At least put a table in the restroom to place things on.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was 80 degrees out and the cabana bar was closed very disappointing.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Nice patios and spacious however.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not good breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Mattress seemed to be hot and cheap.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room in North was way too tiny.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Disappointed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only good thing is that is close to the village.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had an overall pleasant experience for just a one night stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The carpet was old and the room was very musty smelling but very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Not your typical looking hotel room but quite spacious.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I have a bad back and the mattress was quite hard.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The front office should have told us;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rooms were old.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Hair dryer died so they had me dry my hair in another person's room until it was replaced the next day.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Diner attached in front very expensive with little portions.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Better pricing and quality at other diners in area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Good location to village and nice view of the lake.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was fineneed some updating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Towels were skimpy soaps in the showers were not enough.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Everything was great!!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
I enjoyed my stay nice clean room and a friendly staff.;1;0;0;1;1;0
The room and amenities  were well maintained.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great little gem that is close to everything!;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was offered an upgrade when I checked in and couldn’t have been more pleased.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Wish the beach front was cleaner and that kayaks were included in the cost.;1;0;0;0;0;0
It would be nice if there were vending machines or food/drink options available closer to the pool are!;0;1;0;0;0;0
I really enjoyed my stay here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was clean and the staff was friendly.;1;0;0;0;1;0
It had that rustic lakeside feel I was looking for.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The location was great near all the bars and restaurants.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Close to the lake.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Rented the kayaks.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beach too small for swimming.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Walked into the shopping areas even to the mini golf course.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Enjoyed the inn and Lake George.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was OK.  Outside appearance is quite nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our room on the inside was dated and had a musty odor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The pool is nice but the beach is literally for the ducks.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Prices are high during the peak season I’d probably try another place next time there are a lot around.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great Location Staff was friendly and helpful.;0;0;1;0;1;0
Room was clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Great value!;0;0;0;0;0;0

Will be staying here again hopefully next year.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location of property is excellent with most everything within walking distance.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The room however did not have the routine little extras that most do  e.g.;0;0;0;1;0;0
coffee maker hair dryer iron.;0;1;0;1;0;0
If you don't mind bringing you own everything else fine.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They have their own small private beach with lounge chairs.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quiet and relaxing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We would definitely book again and just bring our own 'extras'.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was clean and neat.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Wifi would not work for me really.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Enjoyed my stay;0;0;0;0;0;0

Stayed in a cute cabin with an Adirondack theme.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The cabins are nice and quiet and have grills and fire pits for use while watching the brook.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The owners are attentive to your requests.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We have stayed here multiple times and are sure to return again in the future.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Motel was clean but believe that the cottage was off balance as bed did not set well.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Cottage was small as not much room to move around or sit as only 2 chairs.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Felt cramped but staff was very nice.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Not sure if would book there again;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was looking for a reasonable place to stay for my daughter and I to do some hiking in the Adirondacks.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This place was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed in the cabins which were on the small side but comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Cabins were in good shape and very clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
All in all better than expected for the price I paid.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Would not hesitate to stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Motel close to everything our stay at lake George was wonderful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was ok.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wish they had breakfast and not just coffee;0;1;0;0;0;0
We will be coming back next summer with our children and grandchildren! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beware that the 'double room' is only 1 bed and even though it claims it can sleep 4 people when we arrived we were charged an extra 20/night so we could have a room that would fit my family of 3.;0;0;0;1;0;0
This was aggravating but we were already there and it being a busy summer weekend had no choice but to cough up the money because everywhere else was completely booked.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Other than that the motel is adequate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was told not to use the 2nd bed in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
thing were jumping on me in the room. :;0;0;0;1;0;0
Brookside is not fancy but it's clean and kept up well.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The folks are friendly and ready to fix any issue you might have.;0;0;0;0;1;0
It's convenient to downtown Lake George and is on the trolley route.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Perfect locationclean and staff was very friendly;0;0;0;0;1;0

We spent some time talking about the town and things to do in and out of the summer season.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Like they said 'We're not fancy but we go above and beyond to make sure you all have a great experience.';0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location close to all attractions and the lake.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Owners were great very hospitable.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Pool and hot tub are clean and warmcould be open later though.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The landscape is kept in very nice condition and the rooms are updated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We arrived about 1/2 hour early.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our room was ready and available  for us to occupy.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We were given the keys and directions to our room by the gentleman at the front desk.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room was generous in size with a fairly large bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Just a few days away to relax and enjoy.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Away from the busy but close enough to go to many of the attractions in the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
old seasonal motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But!;0;0;0;0;0;0
well maintained fair deal and staff is really nice.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Great value just off the main area of Lake George Village.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Older property that is well kept on the exterior.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The beds and pillows were comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Linens are dated and thin.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bathroom has nice flooring but the shower needs to be updated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
parking is right front of the cottage.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Coffee made available in the morning.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Easy access to swimming pool.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel staff were very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The only complaint I have is that the shower head didnt work.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Everything else was great;0;0;0;0;0;0
If you’re fancy and picky don’t even bother staying.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I loved the hotel in every single way and don’t get why there were so many negative reviews here.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Hotel is nice if your on a budget.The owner Tony is a very nice guy and will make you feel welcome.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would stay here again if I return to lake George.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We absolutely loved it and will be going back again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms was perfect and more than what we expected however the condos were too far away from restaurants pools beach and all other hotel amenities.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Beautiful resort with great ammenities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only issue i have is being sent out of the main resort area which is what i thought i had paid for to a different property which looked nothing like the area i intended on staying at.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Other than that highly recommend this place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Rumbling Bald Resort was nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room not so much.;0;0;0;1;0;0
They were very outdated and in major need of renovating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The area was great dining was good and the golf course was in great shape considering all of the rain that's came in the past couple of weeks it just could've been that much better if it weren't for the room...;0;0;1;1;0;0
Very nice place to JUST RELAX no internet access on phone while out and that will make you stay at your room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Tv went out but it was fixed and they gave me a 25 gift card for the inconvenience and I gave that away to a couple cause we were leaving early that morning.;0;0;0;1;0;0
People next door was like they were in our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
But don’t let this discourage you from going but I will not be going back there.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Orbitz site did not specify that motorcycles wasn't allowed on the property so I rode mine and it made a big inconvenience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Did not realize when I made the reservation that my room would be literally a mile down the road.;0;0;0;1;0;0
You had to drive EVERYWHERE.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Advertised lazy river...did not say bring your own rafts.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was very disappointed;0;0;0;0;0;0

Hot water was stinking like rotten eggs.;1;1;0;0;0;0
No shower during my two day stay.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was unbearable to wash in.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The last day there the 'waitress' acted like she didn't know anything about the breakfast we were supposed to receive.;0;1;0;0;0;0
So I just paid for it all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very much upset about this booking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Outdated amenities lacking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
E.g.;0;0;0;0;0;0
1tiny bar of soap extra pillows had no pillow cases dimly lit stained carpeting.;1;1;0;0;0;0
Unfortunately I️ could go on.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was very nice allowed us to check in early without asking.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Super nice with lots to do and very friendly people.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Wonderful staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
DVD in room did not work.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No extra blankets and cooling system was a bit outdated couldn't put it on a specific temperature so it just ran all night no auto shutoff.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Other than that...wonderful place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed overnight in this motel while visiting the Sarnac Lake and Adirondack Park.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was small but comfortable and quiet.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only complaint might be the high price considering the lack of amenities though the place was full so price may be comparable to others in area.;0;0;1;0;0;0

Location was perfect.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Chuck the property manager was beyond accommodating.;0;0;0;0;1;0
He’s an asset.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I found the per night cost a bit high and the cleaning fee excessive.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Only drawback.;0;0;0;0;0;0
New clean good location good staff could use a blind on window above kitchen sink just that extra sense of privacy when there is a shoe store parking on other side also bed could be better on wheels and moves and spring  mattress was  squeaky and made a lot of noise.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Would suggest upgrade to a better bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Our 1 bedroom suite was very clean well updated and spacious.;1;0;0;0;0;0
We were across the street from a market and less than a mile from main street shops and restaurants.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Was a wonderful place to stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The hotel is basic but clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0

Bed was very hard and air con just about did the job.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The ensuite was good nicely done and clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
This is a basic hotel for stop overs or possibly business travellers it's not a holiday venue.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We Often use La torre as our Base to get around we enjoyed our stay all staff helpfull and friendly;0;0;0;0;1;0

My sheets was not changed.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The room was not cleaned at all.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Advised front desk but didn’t really cared.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Construction all around me for my 2 days stayed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very noisy and workers are working past 6pm.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Found room and bedding to be clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Nice  quiet;0;0;0;0;0;1

Great bed and pillow.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Cheap no thrills motel that did us ok for a night.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The construction/ road work going on right outside motel made driving into and out of motel difficult but beyond their control I guess.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only thing good about this place was its location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Otherwise every single aspect of this building inside and out was dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Carpet inside the room was dirty microwave was dirty bathroom tub was dirty.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Small tube TV picture quality was horrible extremely grainy Remote wasn’t working.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Shady people  construction no WiFi old box television;0;0;0;1;0;0
Stayed for one night en route between San Francisco and Mammoth Lakes/Devil's Postpile.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It served its purpose - a decent bed a shower etc.;0;0;0;1;0;0
There was some overnight road construction that night and we had the corner room near the construction...but the curtains were good enough to keep the additional lighting out.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Check in and check out were simple.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They weren't going to honor our reservation because they were overbooked.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Luckily we arrived early and got the last room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
That was scary!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room smelled.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Sheets had human hair on them.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Sheets were not clean and unchanged when we arrived.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Untidy and bad odor of carpet..bath towel is tiny and smells bad..uncomfortable tv screen;1;0;0;1;0;0
It was a quit stay and the staff was great.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The check in was super fast under 5 min.;0;0;0;0;0;0
And they respected our privacy;0;0;0;0;0;0
I wanted out of there as soon as possible.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No rest there bed was awful.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Hated the location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Room was tiny toiletries only available on request no breakfast 'nonsmoking' but smelled of smoke and had an ashtray in the room.;1;1;0;1;0;0
I think this motel is giving most of us what we are looking for a nice clean affordable room to sleep in and we don't care about fancy wallpaper.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Thank You Motel 6 for a nice stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean room quick check in staff always polite and efficient.;1;0;0;1;1;0
No microwave in room and very small tv but the heater AND beds were great.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Because of the price and being dog friendly we have stayed there several times this year.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Great centeral location when we see concerts or have family events in Tahoe!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Very good service great breakfast close to beach and directly connected to the Ostsee Therme in case of bad weather.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Walking distance to Scharbeutz and Timmendorfer Strand downtown areas for dinner and shopping - perfect place;0;1;1;0;0;0
Older facility but clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Owner and staff very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We were a little shocked at first arriving.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We are used to more upgraded hotels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was one of the most cleanest places we've ever stayed at.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Staff was friendly and nice!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Only problem was toliet paper stock.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Very quaint motor lodge old school but nice as advertised.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Easy to find and close to a few places to eat.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Overall good experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We really liked our room #45 it was in the back and not on the highway.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Everything was clean and everyone was friendly and helpful Would  stay there again;1;0;0;0;1;0
It almost fealt like home.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's just a place to sleep.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The WiFi was terrible - you had to wait to 2am to be able to work/answer emails;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice place clean great rates friendly!;1;0;0;0;1;0
Dated but clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Close to town.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Problems with toilet but that could happen anywhere.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Staff worked immediately to fix it.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Overall decent place to stay for a weekend at a reasonable price.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We found the  Mahoning Inn to be convenient very clean and comfortable with a friendly staff and great view of the mountain!;1;0;0;0;1;0
I had a clean room and the customer service is great!;1;0;0;1;1;0
I have stayed here 4 times and each time I was satisfied!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very close to shopping and food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The room is very small but comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
My biggest complaint is the moth ball odor in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It must be something the cleaning staff uses because it was very powerful each day we returned to our room.;1;0;0;1;1;0
The odor was nauseating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The bathroom sink faucet was reversed left for cold and right for hot.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We at first thought we didn't have any hot water but figured it out.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Otherwise the room was clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The room was very dated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Not enough space in the bathroom for toiletries and the bed was very firm.;0;0;0;1;0;0
This met our needs though because we only wanted to sleep.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Not recommended for long stays and I think the price was high for the quality.;0;0;0;0;0;0
But it did suit our needs at the time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not fancy but that's okay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Don't feel the need to pay more for that.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It was clean comfortable with friendly staff.;1;0;0;0;1;0
The best things about Eastover are the location the mansion and the beautiful property.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Our room in one of the outer buildings was adequate.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The breakfast left much to be desired.;0;1;0;0;0;0
An absolutely wonderful weekend.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Peaceful and friendly and the staff is terrific.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The accomodations are rustic but we had a large and comfortable room with a great view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The grounds are spectacular and the entire place is set up to promote an easy interaction with guests.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We took a couple of excellent tai chi classes.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Indoor swimming pool is great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
An entirely pleasant warm relaxed atmosphere.;0;0;0;0;0;0
incompetent staff could not fix anything they yes you and do nothing to fix the problems not good service at all wifi did not work the whole trip lied about  breakfast tv channels did not have sound very little hot water;0;1;0;1;1;0
We enjoyed our stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice room and pool.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Friendly staff although seemed a bit overwhelmed.;0;0;0;0;1;0
This is great for wellness retreats but not really set up well for a hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Gorgeous views.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Best breakfast ever — yummy and ultra healthy.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Scenic location and close to Tanglewood downtown Lenox and hiking trails.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Sparkling and impressive indoor pool and extensive gardens and grounds.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wonderful laid back environment and unique surroundings.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The breakfast was delicious and healthy.;0;1;0;0;0;0
We stayed at the Ranch and the room was pretty basic.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Another chair would be good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The beds were comfortable and the towels plush and soft.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was expecting rustic but it was a bit more rustic than I was expecting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Sevice was very nice and accommodating.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Deborah was very hospitable and the Retreat Center is fantastic.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were off season and the area was fantastic even with some snow.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The estate was empty the two nights we stayed they often hold large retreats.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Cool old estate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Could definitely use some updating though we were okay with a more rustic stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Enjoyed the peace and quiet and the kids enjoyed having the pool to ourselves and the beautiful estate.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We will go again in the future - so much better than a stay at a chain.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We went to Tanglewood Kripalu and Jacob's Pillow.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Perfect location!;0;0;1;0;0;0
The mansion and surrounding grounds are spectacular.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was incredibly welcoming and lovely.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Our room was gorgeous and spotless.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Rooms were comfortable and clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Happy hour was fabulous!;0;0;0;0;0;0

Free parking and security/Safety was comforting.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Everything was easy and enjoyable from check-in to check-out!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Happy hour was a nice little bonus parking was across from the hotel in the casino and extremely secure.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Staff were extremely polite and helpful and the rooms were beautiful clean and had everything we needed and more!;1;0;0;1;1;0
And lastly very centrally located!;0;0;0;0;0;0
We would definitely stay again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
An excellent all-round stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Particularly good were: the welcome service throughout the hotel and day the general ambiance in the common areas the complementary happy hour of drinks and snacks and a great location.;0;1;1;0;1;0
The room was a little dark with only a small courtyard window and there was a logistical problem with the safe that could not be fixed during our stay but neither of these detracted from the quality of our stay.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Wonderful courtyard hotel close to everything.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful Room with high ceilings.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only thing there was only one small window I.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bathroom.;0;0;0;1;0;0

Beautiful room with nice bathroom and deck for relaxing.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Breakfast was good and staff were very helpful.;0;1;0;0;1;0
I was really disappointed in the pool not because it was small but because it did not look clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The water looked murky and dirty.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Wonderful hotel in Leon!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful  clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
we booked the presidential suite and when I got there they were rating it 1/3 of the price I paid.;0;0;0;0;0;1
besides it was not even close a presidential suite.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lack of service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
stayed for a night after a meeting in Leon great hotel 2 blocks from the center.;0;0;0;0;0;1
definitely an excellent choice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I liked the fact that it had a small fridge and microwave in the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good water pressure for shower.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Upon arrival to the hotel staff stated they did not have our information from Expedia so they could not honor agreed terms.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Not coffee or tea in the room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Breakfast was 'Snacks'.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Observed a drug deal transaction in parking lot.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beds were the only saving grace.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Won't be back.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Old property but exceptionally clean and really comfortable bed.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Had plenty of light even individual lights over the beds.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were pleased with the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only down was the lack of a coffee machine in the room.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Reserved a king room- they were filled at check in  reserved 2 week’s prior!;0;0;0;1;0;0
Cracked bathroom fixtures toilet flush difficult hot water limited!;0;0;0;1;0;0
The room was very clean but there was a sickly sweet disinfectant smell a cross between a car air freshener and a urinal cake that was overwhelming.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The beds were very comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There was a 1/4' gap around the door where air came through and even though we had the heat on the highest setting we were cold all night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room was spotless.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Owner was super nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I was a little worried because this is an older hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were in the area for a concert.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I even brought my own sheets just in case but I didn't need them.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We would stay here again for sure.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A bit small but a nice quite place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They made you feel at home.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I'd stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Aussie man checked us in and gave a free upgrade to a king sized bed.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We really appreciated that since it was our honeymoon.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Place was clean for an older motel.;1;0;0;0;0;0
He came us directions to the Swinging Bridge and where to go for restaurants.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The River Wild production staff stayed here!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Did not exspect  to much from the outside appearance.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Older motel well kept but you know what I mean.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Check in standard friendly office small ring bell etc.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Opened door to room and different world.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Updated and well done.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Actually most comfortable bed on our whole trip.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Understand it is pet friendly but did not smell any! LOL;1;0;0;0;1;0
You never know what to expect in small towns with mom and pop like properties.;0;0;1;1;1;0
This was pleasantly surprising!;0;0;0;0;0;0
It may be an older facility but the room had been updated and was VERY clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Staff was friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They know how to take care of their guests.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A working ice machine  in room coffee makers would add an excellent touch.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Our room was very comfortable and the staff very friendly and willing to help.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Would definitely stay there again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
small motel - they were working on the exterior - nice backyard area for pets to run.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Would stay there again when in the area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Stayed one night before moving on to Kalispell.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Greeted nicely by woman at the desk room was clean very dog friendly has a dog run breakfast was sparse so we went to a grocery store instead.;1;1;0;1;1;0
Only complaint is having to walk through snow to get to our room.;0;0;1;1;0;0
For the elderly that is a safety issue.;0;0;1;1;1;0
If you are looking for modern luxury then Sandman is not your motel but if you want clean basic comfort at a good price the Sandman is a good option.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Only complaint was the internet signal was weak and connection was slow we were in the end room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Easy check in friendly staff nice small place.;0;0;0;0;1;0
City was quiet when I was there;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice rooms and resort with private beach and many pools.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only problem was fitness room under remodel and no sauna or steam room;0;0;0;1;0;0
Super fantastic place to go.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pictures will not do it justice!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only element we missed was a walking path without steps or steep hills.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It is a great place to take a stroll with a view and yet we were not able to do that on the property.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Other than that it was magnificent.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Incredible service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Hotel is excellent.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff is great beaches and pools are close and abundant.;0;0;0;0;1;0

The staff is exceptional!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Every one of them goes above and beyond to make certain you are comfortable and having the best holiday imaginable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The property is immaculately maintained.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only hard part was leaving.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Fully worth the money paid lots of things to do on the premises nice and friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice hotel close to town good English speaking staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Clean room.;1;0;0;1;0;0
good gardens and pool;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff in the hotel are all friendly and very helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The rooms are clean and appropriately furnished including tea making facilities.;1;1;0;1;0;0
The self-service breakfast offers a good range of food catering to a variety of tastes.;0;1;0;0;1;0
The hotel is situated within walking distance of Lilongwe Mall where there are banking and shopping facilities.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I like how central this hotel is to amenities.;0;0;1;0;0;0
It was mostly quiet.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast was provided and the omelet station is a hit.;0;1;1;0;0;0
Water pressure in the shower was very low and the housekeeping staff woke me up everyday with the carts and talking in the hallway.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The hotel has a pleasing layout and attractive grounds.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A good restaurant and business facilities were particularly appreciated as were the staff who were friendly and helpful for the most part.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The room was pleasant with good amenities.;0;0;0;1;0;0
At the time I visited southern winter the pool was being renovated and the hotel had hot water problems but the latter was fixed within 24 hours.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My stay was nothing to write home about.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel itself is quite dated but none the less clean and quite.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The room is quite large and comfortable but the water pressure and heat in the shower was not good.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I found the reception team to be a little unfriendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The resturant was pleasant service was excellent food average however limited choices and quite expensive.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Stayed a couple of nights on husiness.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food was Good staff happy to help fast internet comfortable bed - a brilliant stay.;0;1;0;0;1;0
Would definitely stay again!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Hotel needs a renovation urgently especially the entrance the fountain etc is outdated.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The restaurant needs to be REVAMPED.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The appliance of the hotel looks very tired and old.;0;0;0;0;0;0
it needs tobe upgraded like the capital or Mt Souche.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel was clean and friendly but required an upgrade.;1;0;0;0;1;0
The buffet breakfast was great!;0;1;0;0;0;0
Hotel hasn't been renovated for a while.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food not good in terms of varieties and quality;0;1;0;0;0;0
Read great reviews but I was not impressed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room 507 has weak to no wifi and no air conditioning.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Lima can be warm and muggy as it was during my stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
To cool off you get a ceiling fan and open windows which lets in the noise from the very busy Miraflores traffic outside.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The full size bed was too firm.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Breakfast buffet was ok.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Location is good for most things as Miraflores is the most popular place to stay in Lima;0;0;1;0;0;0
So happy they are very nice;0;0;0;0;0;0
Great location and staff was helpful.;0;0;1;0;1;0

Excellent staff and nice hotel but there were two let downs: the quality of the dinner we had at the hotel and the fact that the room does not come with a mosquito net when there are warnings about malaria everywhere.;0;1;0;1;1;0
Even when we asked for a mosquito net one was brought for us but it did not properly cover the bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This should be standard and done properly.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel used by our bird tour.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed there as part of the tour and did not use any of the facilities near by.;0;0;1;0;0;0

You can even borrow walking poles from the reception.;0;0;1;0;1;0

Although it is definitely not a 4 star.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff is nice and they all mean well but one person was helping people check in and out while supporting other guests in robes coming out of the pool.;0;0;0;0;1;0

Nice on the outside.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Well maintained landscaping with great statues around the property.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The smell was awful.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Not the cleanest.;1;0;0;0;0;0
I think it was all of the carpeting needing a cleaning to eliminate the smell.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Bed left me aching and stiff.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Woke up with pain for the entire day and a stiff neck and shoulder.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Worst sleep.;0;0;0;1;0;0

It’s been a long time since I’ve stayed somewhere where they didn’t look my reservation up on a computer and handed me actual keys to my room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The room was ok.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was mostly clean but there was mold/mildew on the shower curtain and the carpet by the bathtub.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The beds were ok but I didn’t sleep well in them.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room looked and smelled old and tired.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Furniture old and worn.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A lot of disgusting pubic hair on bathroom floor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The AC unit mounted over the headboard sounded like a freight train making it impossible to sleep.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Very picturesque old brick building with a court yard and gazebo taking you back in time to the 50's and an awesome free selection of movies.;0;1;1;1;1;0
But next time in Lockport we will stay at the Best Western.;0;0;0;0;0;0

We were in the original wing which had very small cramped rooms with a lingering smell of cigarettes.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The faucets were difficult to operate and the hot water was scalding.;0;1;1;1;1;0
The price we paid was double what the room was worth.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Have a great time every time €€€€€€€€...............mmmmm......;0;0;0;0;0;0
Ask to stay in the newer part as the old rooms are very outdated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Very ordinary motel with LOTS of rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
They lost my pre-paid reservation but found it again just as I asked about other hotels in the vicinity.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The room was clean however the refrigerator did not work.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Also the free breakfast served frozen fruit and chilled muffins.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Very poor quality;0;0;0;0;0;0
This room was behind elevator.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was rented on a Saturday so I heard the elevator non stop and loud guess.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Beautiful grounds.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stay was good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0

Chief Logan Resort is Wonderful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
From the Staff to the Rooms I personally wouldn’t stay anyplace else.;0;0;0;1;1;0

Here at Chief Logan for the first time and not disappointed !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Check in was usual.;0;0;0;0;0;1
No hone and very bad internet.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The food in the restaurant was far below what I expected.;0;1;0;0;0;0
My room as the clean until 5.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The parking lot was crowded with construction workers being loud and drinking beer.;0;1;0;0;0;0
I spent most of my time in a parking lots t in a fairly nearby strip mall on the phone and conducting business the purpose behind the trip.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The Mexican workers should be reminded that some American do speak Spanish!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Overall our experience was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
There were 2 flaws with our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The air conditioner was leaking and the exhaust fan was broken.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The view was absolutely beautiful.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We would definitely stay again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very centrally located.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Staff were friendly and very helpful with suggestions and guidance.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The walls are thin so noise from the hallway is an issue in the morning but if you are an early riser or use earplugs don’t let that deter you.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My wife and I were very happy with our stay here!;0;0;0;0;0;0
We were there just for lunch and I had a fast so I can't comment on the taste of the food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
But my colleagues said that the food was good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
They had verities of foods and drinks.;0;1;0;0;0;0
And everyone was enjoying the lunch so it was worth it.;0;1;0;0;0;0
All the decorations interior furniture here is up to the mark.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The staff was very friendly but one thing that disappointed me that they didn't allowed me play ping-pong because of some timing issues or whatever.;0;0;0;0;1;0
But it was still worth it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good hotel for stay and for food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
The service is very good and they keep the place very clean and it's pet friendly .;1;0;0;0;1;0
I enjoyed taking my dogs to this place .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice place to live for a perfect holiday.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Helping staff  good amenities.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Easily accessible to main market of lonavala.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good facility.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Helpful staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Quality food.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Overall awesome experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Moneys worth.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel and service is very good.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Location is in the market itself.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms are nice ambience was good and food was excellent as well.;0;1;0;1;0;0
The only minus point was that there was no recreational activity.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The carrom board was poorly maintained  as was the table tennis.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Also the rooms don't have any views if you want a view and the executive room is quite small but beautiful nonetheless.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Also there is no extra space to roam in the vicinity and for doing anything else that's why the one star less.;0;0;1;0;0;0
But overall if u want location accessibility wise service and good food this place is great.;0;1;1;0;1;0
It's a good hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Room service is fast.;0;0;0;1;1;0
Staff is good.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Location is near to the highway and station.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms are good and spacious.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Location was near main market.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Rooms were neatly maintained.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Swimming area was open to watch even by visitors.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Had breakfast would rate 2/5.;0;1;0;0;0;0
No taste and less variety.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Have paid 7500 for a room which was not worth 7500.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nice place for a night's stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It is a hotel and not a resort as name suggests.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Charges are on the higher side for a kind of property it is.;0;0;0;0;0;1
✓You can come here if other rooms are costing you exhorbitantly high.;0;0;0;1;0;0
✓Rooms are quite bigger in size. ;0;0;0;1;0;0
A good place for a family outing good ambience and friendly reception.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Pool is good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very near from city centre parking space freely available.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Food is served well and tasty also.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Local transportation for tours also arranged at reasonable price;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not good !not facility!;0;0;0;0;0;0
No management No system!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Food quantity not good Behaviour not good;0;1;0;0;0;0
7000/ni8 paid  Rooms like 700/night Breakfast bread they don't provide roasted bread no spoon  They are interested in outdoor customer for restaurant  They think that they are giving free breakfast and doing donation for customers  Do teeth and muscle exercise;0;1;0;1;0;0
Overall It was ok breakfast was rubbish swimming pool very dirty room was ok;1;1;0;1;0;0
Overall resort is good but services to be improved.;0;0;0;0;1;0
You have to ask again again for toiletries.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Package was including wifi but wifi was not provided.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lift was also malfunctioning often.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Water park and location is excellent.;0;0;1;0;0;0
stay Is just ok. moreover issues with payment part.;0;0;0;0;0;1
hotel denied to share invoice  had issues with billing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good for water park but hotel condition needs to improve.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Cleanliness is the main factor of rooms which needs to improve along with proper AC functioning.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The restaurant food is very good.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Was good location was nice and the water park is an added bonus;0;0;1;0;0;0
A very bad experience very rude front deskextra charges and zero customer service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
They are only bothered about charging you for every little thing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I would not recommend even if free.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Water park was the best part of the trip reception and staff showed good hospitality amusement arcade staff was uninterested cleanliness of changing rooms toilets wash rooms was an issue;0;0;0;1;1;0
Over all experience was generally okay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hotel Execurive suite was priced very expensive 52k for 2 nights over weekend.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Value for money not recd.;0;0;0;0;0;1
It included only breakfast.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Swimming water was slightly green in color or rather unhygenic.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I have at better hotels 3/4 star rating at much competitive rates;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was a good experience staying at Lagoona room was excellent food was okay but the Buffet dinner was not up to the mark was not even value for the money need to check out.;0;1;0;1;0;0
Over all it was a good staying. Thanks;0;0;0;0;0;0
It’s was good experience .it was our second trip to lagoona and it was amazing.the view is too good and most important it’s not located in crowded place.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The room was very clean and hospitable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The staff were friendly and helpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
At Lonavala  The lagoona resort  Locationamenitiesservicecleanliness of hotel and room all superb up to mark.......great place to visit;0;0;0;1;0;0
Food was very nice..;0;1;0;0;0;0
It was a great stay in in the Lagoona.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Lobby was good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
In Breakfast had lot of options.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Breast fast serving was in beautiful location;0;0;1;0;0;0
Hotel has reasonable good facilities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It's value can be increased by provision of gymnasium and sports activities.;0;0;0;0;0;1
overall experience was good  but a little improvement on service speed will make it better.;0;0;0;0;1;0
personal opinion will be to improve on the gaming zone area for kids as well as for adults e.g  snooker etc.;0;0;1;0;0;0
otherwise food and other facilites were nice .;0;1;0;0;0;0
but still scope of impreovement on menu can be added .;0;1;0;0;0;0
Overall Good.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was not a great at all the door was stuck and my mum was in the room and unable to open the door and even from the outside .;0;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel person had to change the lock which was inconvenient for me waiting to get the stuff fixed and spending my time;0;0;0;0;0;0
Its more of hotel than resort.no wow feeling.not more than rs1500 per day worth.Very old property with no maintenance.;0;0;0;0;0;1
swimming pool is dirty and not worth bath.only consolation was the food.overall not worth stay and recommendation.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Room was not ready.;0;0;0;1;0;0
On the third floor and lift was out or order.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Bathroom facility was basic.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No fridge in the room to put my medication in.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No hair dryer.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Old towels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Small tv.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Cleanliness of the kitchen was iffy.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Crockery too old.;0;0;1;1;0;0
Wifi only available by the reception desk.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Wouldn't visit this again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Stayed two nights here with our party of three.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The facility was clean and very well kept.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Probably my only complaint was that the beds were a bit on the hard side but if you're only staying a night or two it probably isn't a big deal.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We did not use the pool but the water looked pristine and the area clean and well maintained!;1;0;1;0;0;0
Good experience you feel safety in this small motel.;0;0;1;1;1;0
Room clean and quiet.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Could walk to restaurants and cafes.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Dazzling security lights shone into the room all night.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Smoke entered the room from smokers' table a few feet away;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room was clean and looked recently remodeled.;1;0;0;1;0;0
Shower warmed quickly which was greatly appreciated after a long hike.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Parking was free and right in front of the room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I would stay here again.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Owners are rude and unhelpful.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Was told I couldn't check in until 2:00 pm even though my confirmation sheet said 1:00 pm.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I told him I needed to use the restroom very badly and he told me to walk to the McDonalds down the street.;0;0;1;0;0;0
I'm 70 years old and not what I needed to hear.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room clean and perfectly located Front desk may give you hard time due to computer issue;1;0;0;1;0;0
Nice bathroom room was nicer than I would have expected from the modest motel setup.;0;0;0;1;0;0
I didn't use the coin laundry but it's a nice option when you just got off the trails.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very relaxed place.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was pretty decent for a one night stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms are a little outdated as compared to the Dow Villas but the staff were very friendly and helpful;0;0;0;1;1;0
Very comfortable room;0;0;0;1;0;0
Stayed prior to my hike up Mt Whitney.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Good hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean expensive to to limited rooms in the area.;1;0;1;1;0;0
No complaints at all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Was as expected alth room quite small.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Good choice of places to eat in lone pine all in easy walking distance.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Only concern is that the motel is quite pricey for what you get;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room we stayed in was newly renovated.;0;0;0;1;0;0
It was pretty nice the bed was a little uncomfortable but overall the motel is pretty nice I would recommend it;0;0;0;0;0;0
Easy access.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Friendly staff.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Enough said.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No street noise .;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to Alabama Hills museum;0;0;0;0;0;0
Conveniently situated close to restaurants.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Easy check-in and secure parking.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We reserved this motel for the night before we went backpacking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The room was spacious and clean but the furniture and amenities were a little outdated.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The pool was small but clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Parking was a little tight.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Comfortable and close to beach but dated decor and facilities.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Great staff!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Ocean view great pricing parking is wonderful love trail straight to beach from hotel;0;0;0;0;0;1
It was a fun place the front office ladies are especially nice!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice place!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Wish they had breakfast!;0;1;0;0;0;0
But overall a great value;0;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
This hotel was quite dated and in need of updates.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Pretty run down but overall clean and quiet.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Beautiful view of the ocean from our 3rd floor room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We stayed on the 2nd floor and the balcony was a perfect vantage point to see and hear the ocean.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Getting to the beach only takes a few minutes on a very easy path.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The rooms are clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;1;0;0
The hotel is also pet friendly - we even received a treat for our dog at check-in!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Friendly service  restaurant on site was really good.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Nice view from my room on the 3rd floor.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Been going there since I was kid.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No comment.;0;0;0;0;0;0
It was a little underwhelming but pleasant enough.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Close to the beach although a nice walk away Great place for our events;0;0;1;0;0;0
Great view of the ocean.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Easy check in and checkout.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Wonderful stay with my family.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very close to the beach with balcony and ocean view.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Close to the beach is it.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The place needs some tlc.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Phone didn't work dead bolt lock didn't work wifi didn't work hot tub barely worked.;0;0;0;0;0;1
We a had a fun time.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The only changes I'd make are bring my pillow - the Hotel pillow were truly BAD.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The awful stickers .in the lawn need to go!;0;0;0;0;0;0
Especially with the grandkids along we had constant 'owies' and stickers everywhere.jem;0;0;0;0;0;0
The Chautauqua Lodge's Staff was friendly and provided excellent service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We had a recently remodeled 3rd floor room very clean with a great view of the grass dunes and ocean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
It is a nice hotel but I thought sence it said ocean view we would be closer the the beach then 1/4 mile from beach with someone with a bad knee it was not that close;0;0;0;0;0;1
Room smelled like wet dog there was dry rot in the bathroom with linoleum over it where you could feel yourself sinking into the floor and if anyone was walking above you it sounded like a stampede.;1;0;1;1;0;0
The noise was the worst part for me.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No fan or air conditioning either.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Great job revolving our room problem quickly.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Made out stay great. Thanks;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice bright room with very comfortable beds.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The ocean view and the chairs for the balcony in order to enjoy it were great.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We were so happy with the spaciousness of our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
LOVED that it is right on the beach and close to town!!;0;0;0;0;0;0
We will be back next labor day weekend! !;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel fit the bill for the price it was clean but definitely showing it's age.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Run down a bit and not the higher quality you would expect for a bit more money - so we got what we paid for.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The swimming pool was the strangest thing with very little light and the ceiling torn up and nothing comfortable to sit on while observing older kids swimming.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Again it matched up with the under 100 for a night.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We booked a two bedroom suite - spacious comfortable just fabulous!;0;0;0;0;0;1
Had a beautiful fully equipped kitchen...didn’t have the chance to use it but it would be ideal for a family.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Excellent facilities and services;0;0;0;0;1;0
located within walking distance to a charming downtown with a variety of wonderful restaurants!;0;0;1;0;0;0
Beautiful property.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Large spacious rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0

Lovely hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Extremely convenient.;0;0;0;0;0;0
One of the most comfortable beds I have slept in ever!;0;0;0;0;0;1
We had to upgrade our room.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The one they assigned us to was facing the parking lot and you had to have the curtains closed due to the sun.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Business and pleasure trip.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We loved the location and outdoor patio area.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Excellent property excellent service.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We had a king size suite for 4 people and there was a constant need for towels.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Every day had to call the front desk or go look for a cleaning person in the hallway to grab a few additional towels.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Last day we didn’t get hands towels at all.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Otherwise all was adequate.;0;0;0;0;0;0
I loved this hotel the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful truly exceptional.;0;0;0;0;1;0
We stayed here unexpectedly due to a cancellation at another hotel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The king suite was lovely and had an almost full service kitchen.;0;0;0;1;1;0
We were pleasantly surprised.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The cleaning staff could have done a better job floors were not mopped during our stay and our room was missed one day.;0;0;0;1;1;0
The pool area is nice but bar service would be appreciated  at the  pool.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The staff were helpful and friendly!;0;0;0;0;1;0
Overall a good experience.;0;0;0;0;0;0
This hotel is right across from the wine train and a 5-minute walk from the downtown restaurants and tasting rooms.;0;1;1;1;0;0
We stayed for July 4 and it was so nice to avoid traffic by walking to the fireworks and to be home within 10 minutes of the fireworks being done.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The hotel staff is friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
The place is clean.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The pool is nice.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We'll be back next year!;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel is conveniently located near Oxbow market and a short walk into downtown Napa.;0;0;1;0;0;0
The hotel partners with local wineries and the concierge desk will help you book the tastings.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Cakebread and Pineridge we received free tastings and saved over 125 by using the concierge desk.;0;0;0;0;1;0
Arrival and reaching room was great.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Room was big and had plenty of niceties such as minifridge and small balcony.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Excellent hotel with all amenities.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Heated pool gym big rooms.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Daily wine tastes.;0;1;0;0;0;0

Great location.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Older property that needs some maintenance and upgrades: broken hair dryer dirty walls in need of paint etc.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Extreme run down.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Location was good.;0;0;1;0;0;0
They need to put some money in upgrades.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very nosy as well;0;0;0;0;0;0
The hotel felt more like a motel but that being said location was great staff was wonderful and very accommodating.;0;0;1;0;1;0
And rooms very clean.;1;0;0;1;0;0
there is on parking.;0;0;0;0;0;1
we got there about 1:00 pm they said that we can not check in after 4:pm we left came back about 5 pm there was no parking had to park 1 block away.;0;0;0;0;0;1
rooms were not clean sinks were dirty;1;0;0;1;0;0
The toilet did not close properly after flush therefore it was a hassle to have to get up to reset the lever.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Also all four of the coffee creamer was expired and was not able to be used or consumed.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Hope they will be more deligent to keep them fresh.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Clean and comfortable.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Great value.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Walking distance to Napa town wine tastings and great restaurants.;0;1;1;0;0;0
The motel style facility with the parking in the center court makes for a somewhat noisy environment in the second floor you could hear the maintenance person sweeping at a very early hour service vehicles and the usual traffic of the guess.;0;0;0;0;1;0
As far as location perfect and the front desk very friendly.;0;0;1;0;1;0
No refrigerator.;0;0;0;0;0;0
No microwave.;0;0;0;1;0;0
No phone.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We had a hair dryer fortunately lol;0;0;0;0;0;0
I enjoyed my stay.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The linens were clean crisp and felt great.;1;0;0;0;0;0
Issue with comforter if untuckef just slips off you during the night.;0;0;1;1;1;0
Rate it as a very good high 2 stars.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Hi Perfect small motel.;0;0;0;0;0;0
A bed shower tv and very comfortable.;0;0;0;1;0;0
Only problem is that they recently remodeled - adding more room and not enough car spots.;0;0;0;1;0;0
We had to find parking on the street as the lot was always full.;0;0;0;0;0;0
We stayed during a golf tournament and price was very reasonable;0;0;0;0;0;0
Nice hotel close to downtown shops dining and drinks.;0;1;0;0;0;0
Easily walk to most destinations.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Free parking.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Quick access to major roadways.;0;0;0;0;0;0

I needed a pit stop so I found a cheap place to take a nap and head out in the morning.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The worse driveway that any business could have........loaded with holes !;0;0;0;0;0;0
Aside from that the place is clean and very nice.;1;0;0;0;0;0
The blankets have holes in them house keeping make you bring your own trash and towels downstairs to them you always have to ask for towels soap and tissue and people hang out all in front of the place it makes you feel unsafe..;0;0;0;0;0;1
Total not worth the cheaper rate.;0;0;0;0;0;1
Tv barley worked whole hotel smelled like pine sol.;1;0;0;1;0;0

We booked a room with a queen bed and got a room with a bed that was just a little bigger than a twin size.;0;0;0;1;0;0
When I questioned staff about it they said it lists that it has a queen bed.;0;0;0;0;1;0
So finally the morning of checkout they sent a maintenance guy to check the bed and he took one look and said yep that is definitely not a queen bed.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Thanks a lot for that timing.;0;0;0;0;0;0
They left food in the room from the people before us plus the mattress was had been soaked in blood we only found out because they left a EKG lead still stuck to the side of the bed.;0;0;0;1;0;0
The bad thing about the whole thing is the front desk new about it and new what happened in at room.;0;0;0;1;0;0

I think the Anchorage is really lovely and you can tell it must have been a premium location to be in its day but it is looking a bit tired now.;0;0;1;0;0;0
Maybe a decor lift would make a huge difference.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Very good motel with good facilitys and reasonable priced.;0;0;0;0;0;1
This was a real mixed bag.;0;0;0;0;0;0
The WiFi didn't work the air con was temperamental and building in some sound-proofing for the trains that go past all night would have led to a better nights sleep.;0;0;1;0;0;0
All that said the staff were friendly it is close to some nice restaurants and cafes it has onsite parking plus there is a picturesque harbour walk right outside your door.;0;0;1;0;1;0

Everything was great.;0;0;0;0;0;0
My only criticism is that the woman on the front desk who checked us in was very abrupt and not very friendly.;0;0;0;0;1;0
I don't think that she mentioned to be but maybe that is her personality.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Not the best for a first impression.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Owners  staff are exceptional nothing is an issue - very friendly  welcoming;0;0;0;0;1;0

Well equipped and comfortable.;0;0;0;0;0;0
Due to arriving in Napier slightly earlier than expected I was allowed to check in at 12pm to drop off my gear as I had a meeting from 1.30pm-6pm which was appreciative.;0;0;0;0;0;1
The cleaner was still in our room however no drama.;1;0;0;1;0;0
