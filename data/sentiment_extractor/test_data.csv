This hotel option was a great getaway from the resort crowds during the holidays.;-;-;-;-;-;-
I enjoyed the personalized touch and the serene atmosphere.;-;-;-;-;-;-
Jackie's on the reef is not the ideal option for the adventurous traveler since it's situated way out west with little to do near by.;-;-;-;-;-;-
However there are drivers to take you into town when needed.;-;-;-;-;-;-
Recommended for an extended weekend yoga and spa retreat.;-;-;-;-;-;-
