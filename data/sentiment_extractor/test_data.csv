This hotel option was a great getaway from the resort crowds during the holidays.;-;-;-;-;-;-
I enjoyed the personalized touch and the serene atmosphere.;-;-;-;-;-;-
Jackie's on the reef is not the ideal option for the adventurous traveler since it's situated way out west with little to do near by.;-;-;-;-;-;-
However there are drivers to take you into town when needed.;-;-;-;-;-;-
Recommended for an extended weekend yoga and spa retreat.;-;-;-;-;-;-

The room is fairly small as is typical of NYC but there is still plenty of space to be comfortable.;-;-;-;positive;-;-

Old but quite.;-;-;-;-;-;-

The manager was friendly and helpful.;-;-;-;-;positive;-
Unfortunately the bathroom floor had mold growing and the whole bathroom smelled.;negative;-;-;negative;-;-
